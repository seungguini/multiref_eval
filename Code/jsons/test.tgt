_go Yeah, so I need a big menu _eos
_go Wow, that's a lot of dedication _eos
_go It looks like any other neighborhood _eos
_go That takes so long though _eos
_go Did you get drunk? _eos
_go There's one on her desk _eos
_go That's ok, there's usually a grace period _eos
_go Yeah, but its not like anything else around here! _eos
_go Ok we will stop at the next exit _eos
_go Well lets go to the mall _eos
_go Sorry, I thought that would be funny. _eos
_go You have two savings accounts.  Which one do you want to use? _eos
_go We aren't planning to get married. _eos
_go Yes, coffee is tastes good.  But too much is bad for you. _eos
_go I think they sell tasers at the mall. _eos
_go You should have the hold repaired. _eos
_go Yes, I do pray. _eos
_go Yes, someone can slip and fall. _eos
_go Yes, there's one down the street. _eos
_go Let's play a game of baseball. _eos
_go I really need it to, my grass is drying out. _eos
_go I think cremated, no sense in putting me in the ground. _eos
_go Imported from where? _eos
_go What section of town do you want to look at first? _eos
_go And what have you found? _eos
_go I just go for the special effects! _eos
_go That's possible. _eos
_go A chihuahua _eos
_go Well, maybe they should lower the drinking age to 18? _eos
_go I have to have dental surgery in a few hours. _eos
_go Well, I did. _eos
_go On what items? _eos
_go Yes, but then there are also the bugs. _eos
_go Well you should be able to see crime rates on a website. _eos
_go No, what is wrong with them? _eos
_go Open it and find out. _eos
_go My alarm keeps messing up. _eos
_go Yeah, having all sorts of different passwords is so hard to keep up with. _eos
_go Such as? _eos
_go Then why isn't she wearing it? _eos
_go Have you called 911? _eos
_go That's great! _eos
_go I can't believe it! _eos
_go You could always buy one at the store instead. _eos
_go Okay. _eos
_go I really liked the fondue. _eos
_go Sounds good. _eos
_go It is a lot of work. _eos
_go Because she already has a boyfriend. _eos
_go All that water crashing down on to the rocks freaks me out. _eos
_go I can do $35. _eos
_go I had a bad day. _eos
_go It does, I love that. _eos
_go I got them at the mall. _eos
_go The bus that will take you back is across the street. _eos
_go What is wrong with it? _eos
_go Just making sure. _eos
_go Is she bleeding? _eos
_go It is a half hour. _eos
_go We worked together. _eos
_go What about the pilot? _eos
_go I'm just not a science person. _eos
_go Okay, I'll teach you. _eos
_go Yes, I registered already. _eos
_go Is that all it takes to be good? _eos
_go I go to the state university. _eos
_go Those are the rules now. _eos
_go That's good, are you coming? _eos
_go I used to work as a driver. _eos
_go Just wait for the next bus to come. _eos
_go I have a better idea. Let's go see a movie. _eos
_go You should probably just wait then. _eos
_go Wow, that's a lot of people. _eos
_go I washed all of the socks that were in the hamper. _eos
_go You could look outside just as easily as me. _eos
_go Or maybe they forgot about us. _eos
_go Yeah, I think they will really have an impact on young voters. _eos
_go I guess we're just a couple of bachelors out on the town, then. _eos
_go I think the seat folds up to make room for the chair. _eos
_go I don't understand what that means. _eos
_go There's another one coming up that you can take that can take you to Gage Avenue. _eos
_go Freedom! _eos
_go They had different goals in life. _eos
_go It could be traffic. _eos
_go Really? _eos
_go But they don't have great angles. _eos
_go They stopped working? _eos
_go That happens. _eos
_go She always assumes and doesn't ask me first. _eos
_go You should do it before someone else does? _eos
_go That sounds incredible. _eos
_go What does the second candidate say? _eos
_go Maybe the baby needs a diaper change. _eos
_go Do you have a savings account as well? _eos
_go I want pie for sure. _eos
_go I can't believe it could get even hotter! _eos
_go I don't know if I feel like Italian. _eos
_go Okay, would you like it a couple inches longer then? _eos
_go There's a lot of reasons to vote. _eos
_go I want ice cream. _eos
_go Your transfer will tell you which bus to take. _eos
_go Have you even used the stove today? _eos
_go Is there any extra credit I could do for class. _eos
_go This is exactly the look you asked for. _eos
_go You should move in with me. _eos
_go Why don't I give you a ride? _eos
_go I think I have to be there 2 hours before flight. _eos
_go She is married. _eos
_go You mean like depression ? _eos
_go You have several banking fees to pay. _eos
_go He said that I have the flu. _eos
_go Yes, one is for trash and the other for recycables. _eos
_go I'm sorry, we don't have any storage services. _eos
_go Does the gun have to be registered? _eos
_go You don't wear half of them. _eos
_go Were you injured? _eos
_go How about the local art fair next weekend? _eos
_go What king of food do they offer? _eos
_go They are for my girlfriend. _eos
_go An apples a day keeps the doctor away! _eos
_go Which one? _eos
_go Have you turned it off and back on? _eos
_go Atlanta. _eos
_go I can't, too much to do. _eos
_go And I don't have a backup plan. _eos
_go Take a deep breath and be yourself. _eos
_go Mexican sounds good. _eos
_go I'm wearing it now. _eos
_go Do you have any positions open? _eos
_go They are usually scared of humans. _eos
_go with a nail hammered into the wall _eos
_go I can't tell you have _eos
_go Yes, the competition is up there _eos
_go I'm so relieved _eos
_go I'm from here _eos
_go I did not _eos
_go what happened since? _eos
_go I guess I didn't pay attention _eos
_go go ahead _eos
_go I'm starving _eos
_go But at least you get something. _eos
_go They have early voting day. _eos
_go Good I can make them bigger for the shelves. _eos
_go Too bad I didn't bring them. _eos
_go If it's warm let's go. _eos
_go I had a great time too, would you like to go out again. _eos
_go So leave earlier and take your time. _eos
_go No I am waiting for payday. _eos
_go Because of the "sour"? _eos
_go Is that when you changed your major? _eos
_go wait . you don't know what poison ivy is _eos
_go what kind of pain _eos
_go free wifi _eos
_go why are you transfering _eos
_go what could possibly go wrong _eos
_go oh . sorry _eos
_go i'm worried my classes are too hard _eos
_go huh . i guess it doesn't bother me _eos
_go there must be a catch . it's too cheap _eos
_go first fill in the day of the week _eos
_go Will the ads tell me more about the candidate's views? _eos
_go They talk about their day. _eos
_go Oh my gosh, has it been stolen? _eos
_go Maybe the lock is broken. _eos
_go My parents say it's too expensive. _eos
_go Oh, poor thing! _eos
_go Yes, he often buys me lovely things. _eos
_go I do my own research when I hear something questionable in the media. _eos
_go I'll finish cleaning it later. _eos
_go How awful! I didn't know they were having problems. _eos
_go Perfect, let me check and see if we have you in our system. _eos
_go Honestly, not really. I guess I'd have to lose new ones. _eos
_go Good. Someone needs to. _eos
_go I seriously judge people who didn't. _eos
_go Really, like what? Everyone's wearing crop tops these days. _eos
_go But I don't want to. _eos
_go Excellent. Are you available around 2 pm? _eos
_go Let's go there first. I need new shoes anyway. _eos
_go You're mean. _eos
_go Well first of all, you need to satisfy all of your General Education requirements. _eos
_go OH, well I can't smell anything. _eos
_go No, they tore it down. _eos
_go Do you need a tow? _eos
_go Well it takes some time. _eos
_go What does that mean? _eos
_go That would just interfere with my tv time. _eos
_go Then you can get a walking tour map downstairs. _eos
_go No, someone will spit on our food. _eos
_go No I have a meeting. _eos
_go That sounds expensive. _eos
_go How often do I have to check them? _eos
_go That's the way that most teachers do it. _eos
_go I hate baseball. _eos
_go I still have homework to do. _eos
_go I feel like Italian tonight. _eos
_go I don't know if that's a good idea. _eos
_go It is very safe. _eos
_go What is wrong with the bed? _eos
_go Like the numbers on the clock. _eos
_go What can you tell me about the area? _eos
_go That's where we're headed. _eos
_go Do you want to listen to music? _eos
_go I don't have to be under my parents' roof. _eos
_go Ok, let's do that instead. _eos
_go I don't want to. _eos
_go It's the first time I'm away from my boyfriend. _eos
_go What about looking in the internet. _eos
_go I would like to discuss the last grade I received. _eos
_go Yes. before taxes. _eos
_go Nothing really looks that appealing. _eos
_go All sorts of different ones. _eos
_go No problem, let me give you a hand. _eos
_go Yes I don't like Warhol. _eos
_go What area were you interested in? _eos
_go I'm only going 65. _eos
_go A couple of sandwiches. _eos
_go It would also give you a lot of good exercise. _eos
_go I certainly hope so. _eos
_go OK can you fill this out? _eos
_go I always lose money. _eos
_go To each their own. _eos
_go What are the conditions? _eos
_go I was just scratching it. _eos
_go Neither do I. _eos
_go Cats are adorable. _eos
_go It only takes about an hour. _eos
_go You can sleep when you're dead. _eos
_go You can get one online. _eos
_go Sign the back. _eos
_go But there's so much to do! _eos
_go I'd rather pay a bit more to be safe. _eos
_go Here, use this card for the pass. _eos
_go Well, go ahead and go. _eos
_go I don't care if everyone has one, you are too young. _eos
_go Well just use your fork then. _eos
_go Just a moment and I'll pull that record. _eos
_go No, just sometime before the end of my shift. _eos
_go How is that going to help you lose weight? _eos
_go What are you eating that is different? _eos
_go Of course not. _eos
_go I don't really watch TV either. _eos
_go Well you don't have to tell him do you? _eos
_go Those are the worst! _eos
_go You can register when you get your license. _eos
_go Well I'm getting married next week. _eos
_go That's one of the biggest reasons we moved here. _eos
_go Well I'm surprised you were still waiting. _eos
_go Just around the corner. _eos
_go Well now it's just cheaper to take an Uber. _eos
_go Me too! _eos
_go I had forgotten all about it. _eos
_go The prices are lower than I expected. _eos
_go Who are you going to invite? _eos
_go We do this all the time. _eos
_go It will be busy but fun. _eos
_go I got it on sale. _eos
_go No I forgot about that. _eos
_go That's gross. _eos
_go I grew up speaking two languages in my household. _eos
_go The building is confusing until you get used to it. _eos
_go Did you check in the mailbox? _eos
_go Try to stop using your legs. _eos
_go When would you like to go? _eos
_go Thank you, i'm glad you think that! _eos
_go It was potato soup with cheese and barley. _eos
_go Well how do you do it right? _eos
_go Yes, i would be more than pleased to do that for you. _eos
_go Ya, we need to turn up the heat. _eos
_go He's going to be so excited when he sees this! _eos
_go No i really wasnt thinking we needed to bring a gift. _eos
_go What is it? _eos
_go That's a great idea! _eos
_go What kind of chips? _eos
_go Yes, he is going to be expelled. _eos
_go You need to Google the bus schedule. _eos
_go That doesn't matter. _eos
_go Where did you go online? _eos
_go I know you'll set me up with a total loser. _eos
_go Let me look into that. _eos
_go Nah, I need it to survive. _eos
_go Oh, That is wonderful! _eos
_go There is a secure checking account. _eos
_go It dosen't look very stable. _eos
_go Maybe you should take the bus instead. _eos
_go You can do it yourself at home. _eos
_go I have just finished. Would you like it? _eos
_go The train makes a whistling sound. _eos
_go I am going to visit my mom and dad. _eos
_go It is so beautiful outside. _eos
_go What are you going to buy yourself? _eos
_go Yes, I absolutely love it. _eos
_go That's great! _eos
_go Do I have to this often? _eos
_go Oh, that's too bad. _eos
_go That sounds delicious! _eos
_go Oh no! _eos
_go I know, but I'm still nervous. _eos
_go I have been a lot of fees lately. _eos
_go That's very true. _eos
_go Thank you for meeting with me. _eos
_go I teach 5th grade. _eos
_go Tell you what - make up something and use me as a reference. _eos
_go You will do it now, and then you can go play. _eos
_go Ok, I am happy to help you! Please tell me what questions you have. _eos
_go Yeah I really didn't think about all this before I started dating her. _eos
_go If you get a prepaid pass, you save a little money on the fare. _eos
_go We understand and are happy to discuss your concerns! _eos
_go I am a professional runner. _eos
_go Yes, I have to mark that for our records. _eos
_go How do you ever expect to make a decent living without education? _eos
_go Perhaps it's time to look for a new job. _eos
_go What a great item! _eos
_go No, we need immediate assistance. _eos
_go What were they doing there at 3 a.m.? _eos
_go Really? How do you do that? _eos
_go They kind of look like bubbles in the tea. _eos
_go Will it be painful? _eos
_go 40% seems very high for a tip. _eos
_go That can be downloaded from the app store. _eos
_go It is open late for people like you. _eos
_go It doesn't look like you need stitches. _eos
_go I'm sorry, but I don't know. _eos
_go I'm parked legally. _eos
_go There is a car wash down the street. _eos
_go Do you know where it is? _eos
_go It has lots of shops and restruants. _eos
_go I thought that it came with our meal. _eos
_go What type of job do you want after school? _eos
_go We can make it without buckets. _eos
_go Yes, I'm going to the movies. _eos
_go You should! _eos
_go Me either. _eos
_go Yes, just the other day actually. _eos
_go No problem. _eos
_go Oh nice, what model? _eos
_go Thank you for your honesty. _eos
_go I know right. _eos
_go No I actually just needed a pencil. _eos
_go We should look it up. _eos
_go I'd like the chicken salad. _eos
_go How did he look? _eos
_go And then you chase it. _eos
_go They could go all the way! _eos
_go Kissing someone else. _eos
_go You can wait here, then. _eos
_go Those look good though. _eos
_go Oh, that sounds nice. _eos
_go Can you help me move? _eos
_go It comes from cows. _eos
_go I'm sorry. _eos
_go Then why did you take it? _eos
_go I suggest you focus on the experience rather than the material things. _eos
_go Was it a moving violation? _eos
_go I guess the personal problem was steroids. _eos
_go Yes. Can you believe the price? _eos
_go I agree. _eos
_go I decided to take a year off. _eos
_go You might consider dressing up better for your interview. _eos
_go We wont' make it with that attitude. _eos
_go I moved in about a month ago. _eos
_go Luckily it didn't now please cheer up! _eos
_go Yes, she clutching her chest and having a hard time breathing _eos
_go That's awesome, what makes you want to move to the city? _eos
_go Where was the last place you remember having it? _eos
_go What are you worried about? _eos
_go Probably because he's a good liar. _eos
_go I started dating in Middle School _eos
_go Oh is your PE test outside? _eos
_go That's only the next one comes soon. _eos
_go Yes, but that was with my good friend from college. _eos
_go I wish they would get a move on though. _eos
_go I know, so much to read. _eos
_go You have to be more careful. _eos
_go I didn't know that. _eos
_go I'm on American Airlines and it's terminal B. _eos
_go It's getting worse and worse. _eos
_go Why did you stop? _eos
_go That's proof enough for me. _eos
_go OK I'll go with you. _eos
_go That's strange, I guess it was voter fraud. _eos
_go I am worried about you taking too many classes. _eos
_go I am on a ladder. _eos
_go I have one you can borrow. _eos
_go I also need a notebook. _eos
_go I'm too tired. _eos
_go Yes I do. _eos
_go Not all men. _eos
_go What does that mean? _eos
_go You can be popular without being a cheerleader! _eos
_go Then you should recognize the streets. _eos
_go Get rid of it all together. _eos
_go How'd you manage that? _eos
_go Well, it turns out you do. _eos
_go Man, I wish. Donald Trump won instead, now we're screwed. _eos
_go Can you please elaborate? _eos
_go How much less? _eos
_go Maybe TOO much, if you ask me. _eos
_go I hope not with your car! _eos
_go Why would I be lying? _eos
_go Did you fall out of it? _eos
_go I think that the paint job is very ugly. _eos
_go I think the dog ran across the carpet. _eos
_go The book is so much better than the movie. _eos
_go Can't you give me a break? I'm having a really bad day. _eos
_go I can't wait to watch you play ball! _eos
_go Sure I'm happy to assist you. _eos
_go Why do you think that the brakes need to be replaced? _eos
_go Do you have any diet coke available? _eos
_go Your doctor referred you to come here for more extensive blood testing. _eos
_go No they aren't, don't be silly. _eos
_go Okay, sounds good. Thank you. _eos
_go My shift is from 3 a.m. to 11 a.m. _eos
_go That's very true. Good luck. _eos
_go That's a crazy story to hear. _eos
_go Yes, I like to people watch. _eos
_go Exactly where into the mountains are we going? _eos
_go You are right, let's get started. _eos
_go I am just being honest. _eos
_go Hello John, your credit balance is one thousand dollars. _eos
_go I have worked here for about two years now. _eos
_go Oh okay, that's interesting. _eos
_go I don't want to tell you. _eos
_go Okay, I'll drop by later and give it to you. _eos
_go No problem. _eos
_go So what happened? _eos
_go That's amazing! _eos
_go Okay, I will do it now. _eos
_go I will be fine. _eos
_go My birthday. _eos
_go Okay here is the money. _eos
_go That's a plus. _eos
_go Yes, I know a few. _eos
_go Yes, all of them do. _eos
_go And there's 50 million more since he got elected. _eos
_go Yes, and I'd advise you to walk away. _eos
_go Late is late, I don't make the rules. _eos
_go Yeah, it was very touching. _eos
_go Let's go sit in the shade. _eos
_go No sir, I do not. _eos
_go Really? Why do you say that? _eos
_go Oh, yes, I'm nervous. _eos
_go Geez. Sorry. Did it really affect you that much? _eos
_go Join a support group. _eos
_go I am 25 years old and a mother of two kids. _eos
_go No, I forgot. _eos
_go Yeah but how else should I get rid of them? _eos
_go Okay, take your time. _eos
_go Not really. _eos
_go No. It's not that loud. _eos
_go That's weird. Take it to the apple store. _eos
_go $1500. _eos
_go I'll just walk in my shoes. _eos
_go I'm so sorry. I can't believe I missed it. _eos
_go Can you make me one too? _eos
_go Oh no. I'm sorry. _eos
_go We just need to look around a bit. _eos
_go Me too. Let's order Chinese. _eos
_go Nope. I'm not into sports. _eos
_go Yep. Just my luck. _eos
_go That's a silly thing to be mad about. _eos
_go That's not how sizes work. _eos
_go Just a couple of more weeks and we'll have enough to get out of this place. _eos
_go Great!  Please fill out an application form. _eos
_go Ha!  I wouldn't push this hell on anyone. _eos
_go What's in Arizona? _eos
_go Michael Jordan of course. _eos
_go That would be great. _eos
_go No I was at work yesterday. _eos
_go A workshop that helps you plan and then write out your statement. _eos
_go I didn't see anything though. _eos
_go No, it's included with your room. _eos
_go I'm not a big fan of hot dogs. _eos
_go Oh, i'm sorry, I didn't notice. _eos
_go What is it about? _eos
_go Or maybe they forgot about us. _eos
_go It's a little crowded in this area for me. _eos
_go Ok, here are some brochures to look at. _eos
_go How about a tie? _eos
_go Well here are a few options. _eos
_go That sound like a lot of work! _eos
_go I do not like boiled peanuts. _eos
_go I don't blame you.  I was scared too when I first got my license. _eos
_go Hello Mr Jones.  How can i help you. _eos
_go What is the price of the house? _eos
_go I have a salad for lunch every day. _eos
_go I know but I want to make sure I get in somewhere. _eos
_go We are driving to California. _eos
_go Not really but I didn't want my grandma to feel bad. _eos
_go I am not.  It has been a long week and I just want to relax. _eos
_go I just will have a small piece.  I promise it won't spoil my dinner. _eos
_go I know but you have to do it a certain way. _eos
_go A night out at a Japanese restaurant. _eos
_go Why do we need to buy a house? _eos
_go Maybe you should move seats. _eos
_go Sure come this way. _eos
_go Oh no, what is it? _eos
_go In the day? A lot. _eos
_go I'm going to bring my painting. _eos
_go He spends so much time playing. _eos
_go Whoa, that's a lot! _eos
_go What cut did you order? _eos
_go At you personally or just in general? _eos
_go Yes, I guess you are right about that! _eos
_go I heard a report that said closer to 45. _eos
_go Do you want to do it? _eos
_go You are a party pooper! _eos
_go I left that at home. _eos
_go Maybe they should live together. _eos
_go Why not? _eos
_go That seems like such an old-fashioned way to do things. _eos
_go I have worked here for 10 years. _eos
_go Yes, it's a new kind of surfboard. It is smaller than the average surfboard. _eos
_go Sure, what do you need? _eos
_go No, we do not allow them to because it will slow down the process of escaping quickly. _eos
_go I wonder if it will be nice. _eos
_go I have a boyfriend already. _eos
_go I agree, they do. _eos
_go Yes, I have you all set for a six am wake-up call. _eos
_go I heard that if you brush your hair too much it will cause split ends. _eos
_go It is kind of weird but I like her. _eos
_go Just return it when you're done. _eos
_go You should really think this over. _eos
_go No, not at all. _eos
_go You can register online now, I'll show you. _eos
_go Thank you. _eos
_go Oh, OK. _eos
_go OK, I'll keep that in mind, _eos
_go No, I didn't. _eos
_go Where have you looked? _eos
_go I agree! _eos
_go That would be so cool. _eos
_go I can't help you with that. _eos
_go It's a stupid game. _eos
_go No, there's no problem. _eos
_go I thought that was a good story. _eos
_go I don't know, it was a gift. _eos
_go OK sounds good. _eos
_go Very good Sir. _eos
_go It's just rude. _eos
_go She has Alzheimer's disease. _eos
_go He must throw a mean fastball! _eos
_go A tap card pays for all my bus trips for thirty days. _eos
_go Do you like to ski? _eos
_go I'm not really interested in trying out. _eos
_go That's because my skates are rollerblades and yours are not. _eos
_go What are you going to order? _eos
_go Is that something you've always wanted to do? _eos
_go Only on the weekends. _eos
_go A volunteer can canvasa neighborhoods and encourage people to vote. _eos
_go It's my favorite. _eos
_go Yes, it is. I hope you have enjoyed the apartment. _eos
_go Well, that's definitely weird. _eos
_go That's too hard to make! _eos
_go You can park it in the main lot. _eos
_go Oh, I haven't read that yet. _eos
_go Wow, does he speak Hungarian? _eos
_go She is holding her chest. _eos
_go Oh, yeah, you're right. _eos
_go Yes, well you need to do it! _eos
_go Were you successful in falling asleep? _eos
_go yes they did _eos
_go not at all _eos
_go No _eos
_go that is true _eos
_go it is _eos
_go Me too _eos
_go I did _eos
_go so were mine _eos
_go no reason _eos
_go a bad one _eos
_go Place it on the belt, please. _eos
_go Well, I have one thousand. _eos
_go I was just going to wear something I already have. _eos
_go Why don't you just ask him? _eos

_go Have they posted the robber's photo? _eos
_go I would love to but I am spoken for. _eos

_go Why not? _eos
_go True, are you good with plants? _eos

_go Pfft. They say that a few times a week. _eos
_go So, no need to be rude about it. _eos
_go Yeah, people use them up quickly so they must like the idea. _eos
_go Thunder roars in indigation. _eos
_go No. It has stars and stripes. _eos
_go What did he say? _eos
_go I want to go somewhere where I can swim and wear my new bathing suit. _eos
_go I'll be glad to answer them for you. _eos
_go You can go to the information booth to find out which bus to take. _eos
_go Yes. I couldn't help it. _eos
_go I don't know. _eos
_go Yes, that's right. _eos
_go What's the big switch? _eos
_go I've been wanting to try it. _eos
_go The prices were fair. _eos
_go Do you know of any job openings to which I might be well-suited? _eos
_go They're probably no dirtier than any place. _eos

_go No, you don't need a prescription for over the counter meds. _eos
_go I appreciate your hospitality. _eos
_go Have a seat and I can assist you? _eos
_go I am sure there is another flight you can take, did you check the schedule? _eos
_go Could I have your purchase order number to look up the sale? _eos

_go It looks like he's going to soon. _eos
_go Was he smoking? _eos
_go I was always better at English. _eos
_go It looks like they haven't changed a thing. _eos
_go But it can also remind people to wish you a happy birthday. _eos
_go If you don't mind I think I'm just going to go to sleep. _eos
_go At least you're getting something though. _eos
_go Well people just don't feel like their vote matters anymore. _eos
_go I failed my last english exam. _eos
_go What's the name of the fruit? _eos
_go To me, one seat is the same as the next. _eos
_go I've also noticed the drop in quality. _eos
_go I don't have any trouble sleeping on it. _eos
_go Where do you want me to start. _eos

_go That sounds like a fun essay. _eos
_go Oh, where are you then? _eos
_go That sounds fun! _eos
_go Which part can I help you with? _eos
_go Why are you so tired? _eos
_go Being 16 means you are not a child anymore. _eos

_go Thank you! _eos
_go Painting sounds boring. _eos
_go Oops. _eos
_go Fair enough. _eos
_go Sure thing. _eos
_go Not now, thank you. _eos
_go Oh, for goodness sake, it's a construction job. They don't expect clean nails. _eos
_go Yep, also bread and eggs. _eos
_go Doesn't it always do that? _eos
_go Let me check on that for you. _eos
_go Do you think we could find a recipe for something like that? _eos
_go It's right around the corner for the subway. _eos

_go I will go try them on. _eos
_go Do you take any medicine for that? _eos
_go Maybe there was an emergency. _eos
_go Bummer. _eos
_go It's not really free. They just include it in the price. _eos
_go I do this all the time. _eos
_go I think so. _eos
_go Across from the CVS on Beacon Street. _eos
_go I'm really sorry, but I'm not going to make it in today. My car broke down on the freeway. _eos
_go It helps loosen my creative juices. _eos
_go I mean, we argue sometimes. _eos
_go You mean a player, or a fan? _eos
_go Ugh, what's the world coming to? _eos
_go Thank you, see you in a week! _eos

_go I see the man I saw robbing the woman outside the bank. _eos
_go I know where it is, I can help you find it. _eos
_go Possibly. Tell me more about my date. _eos
_go Maybe the pasta from last night had bad cheese on it. _eos
_go I would like to leave June 25th. _eos
_go It is 15 dishes that they make and you can have as much as you want from that section. _eos
_go Yes I do, but that won't pay for college. _eos
_go I was 21 year old. _eos
_go I wouldn't know. _eos
_go It doesn't I was merely pointing it out. _eos

_go It's so hot out. _eos
_go Probably. _eos
_go I don't believe in God. _eos

_go I'll need the copy of the check. _eos
_go Have you looked on Craigslist? _eos
_go In about five minutes. _eos

_go Just picture everyone in their underwear! _eos
_go Why not? _eos
_go Alright. You can pay this time. _eos

_go Yes, I do need it. _eos
_go You can't force humor. _eos
_go I see. _eos
_go I won't. _eos
_go Just a few more hours and it'll be over. _eos
_go You need to register before you can see Dr. Taylor. _eos
_go I can't pay for your ticket. _eos

_go I can wipe it off for you. _eos
_go Yes, there are checking and savings accounts. _eos
_go Why don't you do something else? _eos
_go You've lived here so long, it just seems like you would've ridden the bus by now. _eos
_go Look at the signs at the stop. _eos
_go Ok. Just get Basmati instead. _eos
_go The hills are brutal. _eos
_go I don't know! _eos
_go Oh, I don't do that. _eos
_go What did I do wrong? _eos
_go You'd better register early. _eos
_go I need to see your driver's license. _eos
_go it's a toothpick. _eos

_go Do you know where we are? _eos
_go I don't accept late work. _eos
_go Way to go! _eos

_go Why don't you cook dinner you smartass. _eos
_go I remember now, sure get in then. _eos
_go Absolutely I cannot argue with that. _eos
_go What information do you need from me? _eos
_go Why can't I park here there is not sign? _eos
_go No problem what are friends for? _eos
_go I hope you never have to use it. _eos
_go Then bring them out and let's go to trial. _eos
_go I like basketball the most. _eos
_go Thank you for bringing that to my attention. _eos
_go I like my salads with lots of feta. _eos
_go Why would someone want a committee to vote for them? _eos
_go You're still late. _eos
_go Of course that's ok. _eos
_go It's closer to an A-. _eos
_go You should see the Zebra at the fair. _eos
_go At least it wasn't a nail. _eos
_go Whose tires? _eos
_go Ok. We have a budget plan that might work for you. _eos
_go No but the frosting touched me. _eos
_go I'll get my shotgun. _eos
_go Don't be silly. I'm sure you look great. _eos
_go I'm so surprised to hear that. I know they have been having trouble conceiving. _eos
_go Yes, I could hear the people nextdoor talking all night! _eos
_go I guess we start by picking up a newspaper and checking the help wanted ads. _eos
_go She really did. Her dress was amazing. _eos
_go With a basic checking account, you pay a flat monthly fee of $20. _eos
_go I haven't exactly figured that out yet. _eos
_go It's only two blocks from the park with the nice walking trail. _eos
_go Let's start with an easy question. How did you hear about the job opening? _eos
_go Do you know why I pulled you over? _eos
_go That's why I subscribed to cable. _eos
_go How about the pond out back? _eos
_go Which one are you looking for? _eos
_go Now I feel bad for you. _eos
_go Do you have identification? _eos
_go He said that it does. _eos
_go I spilled my drink, I'm sorry. _eos
_go No one would help me. _eos
_go Oh really where? _eos
_go I've read that one before. _eos
_go I stopped eating mayo on my sandwiches and took an hour long walk every day. _eos
_go You can register at the DMV or post office. _eos
_go Well not forever but certainly for as long as the eye can see. _eos
_go How do you know the driver was drinking? _eos
_go What are you going to do with them? _eos
_go How long did it take you to find one? _eos
_go I love Italian food, what time? _eos
_go You would be better off finding a shuttle I have to work. _eos
_go Well then why don't you feed it? _eos
_go Have you tried taking breaks every 20 minutes or so? _eos
_go If that camera caught your plate then you're going to get a ticket. _eos
_go Okay very good. What did you find? _eos
_go It doesn't matter, it's still going to cost you. _eos
_go No that show sucks. _eos
_go Excuse me? I'm only being realistic. _eos
_go To die I guess. _eos
_go Well that's what you really mean isn't it? _eos
_go None of your business. _eos
_go I'm not. _eos
_go Well you've come to the right place! Give me a moment and i'll get you set up. _eos
_go He did amazing, he won by five points. _eos
_go And what did it say? _eos
_go Good we need all the support we can get. _eos
_go I know, I saw you all week. _eos
_go Then why would you start a conversation like that? _eos
_go I'm waiting on my appetizer. _eos
_go Is it from being on the computer? _eos
_go And how is it that they dress? _eos
_go Me too always on my chin. _eos
_go I need some extra balls. _eos
_go Well maybe it's a fire pit out back, let's go see! _eos
_go It's cold and white and soft! _eos
_go If you buy an Apple, six years is nothing. _eos
_go You're right, thank you! _eos
_go Take the bus from Maywood to the midpoint. _eos
_go Maybe it just needs to be tweaked _eos
_go No, I don't want to! _eos
_go Oh mostly blues and country rock! _eos
_go We have burgers and we have apps. _eos
_go No way, i don't want to fall! _eos
_go Me too! _eos
_go Yes, that's for sure! _eos
_go I really should, but I've been procrastinating. _eos
_go I don't see him very much. _eos
_go It's a possibility! _eos
_go What day would you like to come over? _eos
_go I'm excited for you, it's a great place to work. _eos
_go The first time I was, but now I am not. _eos
_go That reminds me of something my mom used to make. _eos
_go Wouldn't that be a dream come true! _eos
_go I hate to see you go. _eos
_go It's a hockey stick. _eos
_go I wish I could, but I'm from out of town. _eos
_go I love the dollar store. _eos
_go What do I need to do to file? _eos
_go That's silly! I'll be careful! _eos
_go No, I just lost track of time. _eos
_go Ok. How can I help? _eos
_go I'll send someone right up to take care of that. _eos
_go Ok. Let's hit the soup and salad place. _eos
_go Hey, don't you be so judgmental. Not all Republicans are the same. _eos
_go Don't worry. I was being careful. _eos
_go I see it. I'll go ahead and cancel that table for 6 people at 6 p.m. this evening, under the name Carlos Jones. _eos
_go I suppose not. Let's go. _eos
_go I bet that's not really true. _eos
_go Yep, it is so calm looking out across the water. _eos
_go No thank you, I am dating someone already. _eos
_go Try your local library. _eos
_go Let me explain a simple formula many home sellers use. _eos
_go Yes, we prioritize enrolling court-mandated individuals. _eos
_go OK let's find a school with a good biology program. _eos
_go I would love to live here. _eos
_go I just don't see it. _eos
_go I have a Chevrolet. _eos
_go Oh my gosh I fell asleep! _eos
_go Yes some guy at the bar hit me! _eos
_go That's going to be expensive. _eos
_go We can look it up on google maps. _eos
_go What should I order with it? _eos
_go I could use another pair though. _eos
_go Is there any way you could possibly move back? _eos
_go Yes it is!  Hopefully you can get that up to the A in no time! _eos
_go I know, my dogs were howling their heads off! _eos
_go Oh my gosh, she didn't?  Really? _eos
_go Let's get that taken care of quickly. _eos
_go No, I think that there is ban on going out into the water right now. _eos
_go I am so sorry, we will send someone up ASAP to remove it. _eos
_go There are alot of kids here that your daughter can play with. _eos
_go It is really close to the shoppiing mall and park isn't it? _eos
_go Is there anything I can do to help you out at home? _eos
