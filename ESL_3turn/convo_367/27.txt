Oh is your PE test outside?
You don't like PE it's the easiest class.
Afraid you'll fail running the mile again?
Does that mean you won't take it, or are they just going to move it inside?
The forecast is probably wrong
They can't just have it in the gym?
They are usually right on that channel.
Good luck to you.
