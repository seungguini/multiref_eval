Oh is your PE test outside?
You don't like PE it's the easiest class.
Afraid you'll fail running the mile again?
Does that mean you won't take it, or are they just going to move it inside?
The forecast is probably wrong
I hope you get lucky.
You can still run in the rain!
They'll just reschedule it.
