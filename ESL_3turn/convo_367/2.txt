Oh is your PE test outside?
You don't like PE it's the easiest class.
They will just do it inside.
Does that mean you won't take it, or are they just going to move it inside?
The forecast is probably wrong
They can't just have it in the gym?
Coach Evans will probably still make you go outside.
Good luck to you.
