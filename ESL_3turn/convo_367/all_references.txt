Oh is your PE test outside?
You don't like PE it's the easiest class.
They will just do it inside.
Afraid you'll fail running the mile again?
Does that mean you won't take it, or are they just going to move it inside?
You are lazy.
The forecast is probably wrong
They can't just have it in the gym?
I hope you get lucky.
You can still run in the rain!
They are usually right on that channel.
Coach Evans will probably still make you go outside.
Good luck to you.
They'll just reschedule it.
