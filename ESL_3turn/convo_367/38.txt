Oh is your PE test outside?
You don't like PE it's the easiest class.
Does that mean you won't take it, or are they just going to move it inside?
I hope you get lucky.
They are usually right on that channel.
Coach Evans will probably still make you go outside.
Good luck to you.
They'll just reschedule it.
