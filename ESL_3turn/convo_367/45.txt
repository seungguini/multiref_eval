You don't like PE it's the easiest class.
They will just do it inside.
Afraid you'll fail running the mile again?
Does that mean you won't take it, or are they just going to move it inside?
You are lazy.
They can't just have it in the gym?
Coach Evans will probably still make you go outside.
Good luck to you.
