Oh is your PE test outside?
They will just do it inside.
Does that mean you won't take it, or are they just going to move it inside?
The forecast is probably wrong
They are usually right on that channel.
Coach Evans will probably still make you go outside.
Good luck to you.
They'll just reschedule it.
