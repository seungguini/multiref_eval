40% seems very high for a tip.
There's already a service charge, though.
I agree.
You can give him a big tip, I'm on a strict budget, remember?
How about a 25% tip to recognize his service?
That's exactly what I'm thinking.
He went above and beyond to make us feel special.
We should thank him personally.
