I agree.
You can give him a big tip, I'm on a strict budget, remember?
That's exactly what I'm thinking.
He went above and beyond to make us feel special.
He was very good at keeping our drinks full.
That works for me. Just tell me how much I owe you.
We should thank him personally.
He was good, but I don't think he was that good.
