There's already a service charge, though.
I agree.
You can give him a big tip, I'm on a strict budget, remember?
How about a 25% tip to recognize his service?
He went above and beyond to make us feel special.
That works for me. Just tell me how much I owe you.
We should thank him personally.
He was good, but I don't think he was that good.
