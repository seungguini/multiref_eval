Please give me a break.
Can't you let me off with a warning?
Come on, officer, my friend is sick.
I am sorry officer.
I understand, I knew that when I parked there.
Are you going to give all these other cars tickets?
I didn't get out of the car, technically I did not park.
But it was only 2 minutes.
