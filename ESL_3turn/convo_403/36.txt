Can't you give me a break? I'm having a really bad day.
What the hell?
Can't you let me off with a warning?
Please don't, I will move.
I am sorry officer.
I understand, I knew that when I parked there.
Are you going to give all these other cars tickets?
I didn't get out of the car, technically I did not park.
