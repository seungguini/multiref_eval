Can't you give me a break? I'm having a really bad day.
Can't you let me off with a warning?
Please don't, I will move.
Come on, officer, my friend is sick.
You don't need to be such a jerk about it.
I am sorry officer.
I didn't get out of the car, technically I did not park.
But it was only 2 minutes.
