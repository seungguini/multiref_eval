Better than all the tornadoes back east!
They don't happen that often.

It's really pretty there.
Don't be so alarmist.
You're right. They are weird for being in those hazardous zones.

There are much better reasons why people from California are crazy.
I hear the traffic is insane.
I think you're crazy...
I imagine it would be a fun place to vacation.
