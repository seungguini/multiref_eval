You can be popular without being a cheerleader!
You're already popular.
Why don't you just start being nicer to people?
Being a cheerleader is hard work.
Well, if that's the only reason why, don't even bother trying out.
They're also stuck-up.
I don't think that's something worth being.
And I hate cheerleaders.
