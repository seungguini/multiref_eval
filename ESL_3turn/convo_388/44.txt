That's not a good reason.
You're already popular.
Why don't you just start being nicer to people?
Being a cheerleader is hard work.
Well, if that's the only reason why, don't even bother trying out.
I don't think that's something worth being.
So what if they're popular? Besides you have to have prior cheerleading experience, which you don't.
And I hate cheerleaders.
