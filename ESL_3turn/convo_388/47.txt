You can be popular without being a cheerleader!
That's not a good reason.
You're already popular.
Why don't you just start being nicer to people?
Being a cheerleader is hard work.
Well, if that's the only reason why, don't even bother trying out.
Good luck with try outs!
So what if they're popular? Besides you have to have prior cheerleading experience, which you don't.
