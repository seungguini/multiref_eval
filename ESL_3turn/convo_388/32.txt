You can be popular without being a cheerleader!
That's not a good reason.
You're already popular.
Why don't you just start being nicer to people?
They're also stuck-up.
Good luck with try outs!
So what if they're popular? Besides you have to have prior cheerleading experience, which you don't.
And I hate cheerleaders.
