That's not a good reason.
You're already popular.
Being a cheerleader is hard work.
They're also stuck-up.
I don't think that's something worth being.
Good luck with try outs!
So what if they're popular? Besides you have to have prior cheerleading experience, which you don't.
And I hate cheerleaders.
