I have worked here for 10 years.
Eh, not too long. I'm only recently hired.
Not that much, I'm just new here.
Only about 6 months.
I am pretty new here, how about yourself?
Yes, actually, I've been working here for five years.
Yeah, I've been here for about two years now.
Yeah, I really enjoy working with the kids. I wouldn't want to do anything else.
