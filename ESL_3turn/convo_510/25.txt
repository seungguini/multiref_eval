Eh, not too long. I'm only recently hired.
Not that much, I'm just new here.
I am pretty new here, how about yourself?
Long enough to hate it.
Yes, actually, I've been working here for five years.
Yeah, I really enjoy working with the kids. I wouldn't want to do anything else.
No, I'm new.
I certainly have.
