Then why isn't she wearing it?
Well, this is awkward. I am very sorry.
Oh I thought it was for you!
I'm sure your mother will love the dress.
Oh, well then it might be too small.
What does she need a dress for?
That was a nice thing to do for your mother, I'm sure she'll love it.
Is that what you got her for her birthday?
