Then why isn't she wearing it?
Oh then yes it's very pretty.
Well, this is awkward. I am very sorry.
Oh, well then it might be too small.
I bet she will like it.
What does she need a dress for?
That was a nice thing to do for your mother, I'm sure she'll love it.
Is that what you got her for her birthday?
