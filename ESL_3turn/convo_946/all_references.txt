No, I don't want to!
Not yet.
No, not yet.
No, where am I supposed to find a mirror in the woods?
Yes, but i can't tell!
Yes, I couldn't tell.
I'm headed to find one right now.
Yeah, that's why I think it's cracked.
NO. Can you check?
What do you think?
Yes, but it's at the back of my mouth so I can't see it.
Yes, it looks like it is.
That's where I'm going now.
I don't have a mirror with me.
Go get me one please.
