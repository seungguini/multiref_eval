Yeah, a some highlighters, a calculator and graphing paper would be good. Thanks.
Paper and notebooks too.
Maybe a new notebook, and a back pack.
I think I just need pencils.
Nah, I'm alright.
Some notebooks would be nice.
A graphing calculator and scientific as well.
I need a lot more, but I can take care of that on my own time.
