You've lived here so long, it just seems like you would've ridden the bus by now.
Because everybody has been on a bus.
I have been taking the bus for many years.
I take the bus all of the time.
You just seem really comfortable with the bus system.
How did you get around before you got your car?
I figured that's how you got to work every day.
You don't have a car.
