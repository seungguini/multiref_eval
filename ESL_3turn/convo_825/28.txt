You've lived here so long, it just seems like you would've ridden the bus by now.
Because everybody has been on a bus.
I have been taking the bus for many years.
Because it is no need to be snippy.
How did you get around before you got your car?
I figured that's how you got to work every day.
How do you get around the city if you don't take the bus?
You don't have a car.
