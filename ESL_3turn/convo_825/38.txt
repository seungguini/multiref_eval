Because everybody has been on a bus.
I have been taking the bus for many years.
I take the bus all of the time.
You just seem really comfortable with the bus system.
Because it is no need to be snippy.
How did you get around before you got your car?
How do you get around the city if you don't take the bus?
You don't have a car.
