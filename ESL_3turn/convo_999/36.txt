Your hard will pay off with a rewarding career.
I have no time.
Would you like to go with me to have a massage later this week?
I respect you for being able to juggle so many responsibilities.
With my student loan debt, I'm not so sure about that.
I can't deal anymore.
My eyes look horrible.
I am not eating well either.
