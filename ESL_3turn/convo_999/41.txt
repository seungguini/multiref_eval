Is there anything I can do to help you out at home?
Just remember your hard work will pay off in the long run.
I have no time.
Would you like to go with me to have a massage later this week?
I respect you for being able to juggle so many responsibilities.
With my student loan debt, I'm not so sure about that.
I can't deal anymore.
I am not eating well either.
