Is there anything I can do to help you out at home?
Just remember your hard work will pay off in the long run.
I have no time.
Would you like to go with me to have a massage later this week?
I respect you for being able to juggle so many responsibilities.
I can't deal anymore.
I am running on no sleep.
My eyes look horrible.
