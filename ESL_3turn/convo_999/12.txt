Just remember your hard work will pay off in the long run.
Your hard will pay off with a rewarding career.
I have no time.
Would you like to go with me to have a massage later this week?
With my student loan debt, I'm not so sure about that.
I am running on no sleep.
My eyes look horrible.
I am not eating well either.
