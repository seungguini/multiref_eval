Is it a quiet street?
It's near the highway.
It's close to the main road, but the unit is in the back of the building, so it'll be quiet.
The apartment is next to your favorite stores and restaurants.
The neighbors look nice.
There's lots of parking.
There's a park near by.
I'll be close to my friends.
