Is it a quiet street?
Crime activities are very low over here.
It's close to the main road, but the unit is in the back of the building, so it'll be quiet.
The ad said they have off street parking. That would be awesome.
The apartment is next to your favorite stores and restaurants.
The neighbors look nice.
There's a park near by.
You can see the water.
