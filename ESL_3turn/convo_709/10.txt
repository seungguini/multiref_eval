It's right around the corner for the subway.
It's near the highway.
It's close to the main road, but the unit is in the back of the building, so it'll be quiet.
The ad said they have off street parking. That would be awesome.
The neighbors look nice.
Well, I'll be able to walk to work.
There's lots of parking.
I'll be close to my friends.
