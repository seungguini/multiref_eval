It's right around the corner for the subway.
Is it a quiet street?
Crime activities are very low over here.
It's close to the main road, but the unit is in the back of the building, so it'll be quiet.
The apartment is next to your favorite stores and restaurants.
The neighbors look nice.
There's a park near by.
I'll be close to my friends.
