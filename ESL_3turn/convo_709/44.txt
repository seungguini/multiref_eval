Is it a quiet street?
It's near the highway.
It's close to the main road, but the unit is in the back of the building, so it'll be quiet.
The ad said they have off street parking. That would be awesome.
The neighbors look nice.
Well, I'll be able to walk to work.
I'll be just around the corner from a park.
You can see the water.
