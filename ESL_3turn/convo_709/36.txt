It's right around the corner for the subway.
Crime activities are very low over here.
It's near the highway.
It's close to the main road, but the unit is in the back of the building, so it'll be quiet.
The ad said they have off street parking. That would be awesome.
Well, I'll be able to walk to work.
There's lots of parking.
You can see the water.
