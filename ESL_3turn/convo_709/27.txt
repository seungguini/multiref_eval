Is it a quiet street?
The ad said they have off street parking. That would be awesome.
The apartment is next to your favorite stores and restaurants.
Well, I'll be able to walk to work.
There's lots of parking.
I'll be just around the corner from a park.
There's a park near by.
I'll be close to my friends.
