It's right around the corner for the subway.
Is it a quiet street?
Crime activities are very low over here.
It's near the highway.
It's close to the main road, but the unit is in the back of the building, so it'll be quiet.
The neighbors look nice.
Well, I'll be able to walk to work.
There's lots of parking.
