I don't have any trouble sleeping on it.
We need to go and look for a new one then.
Well it is pretty old.
Maybe you should try changing your sleeping position.
Why do you think it's uncomfortable?
We've had it for forever and you've never said anything about it being uncomfortable!
Do you want to go shop?
What did you have in mind?
