That sounds reasonable.
They have a lot of great stuff there. I buy from there all the time.
Sounds like you are thinking ahead.
Nice, which dollar store are you going to?
Be careful. Sometimes you sacrifice quality and end up paying more in replacements.
That's a good way to pinch pennies.
How has that worked out for you?
Are you finding good stuff to buy?
