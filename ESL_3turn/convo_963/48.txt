I love the dollar store.
That stuff is so low quality.
They have a lot of great stuff there. I buy from there all the time.
That's a good way to save on some things.
You'll end up spending more probably.
Sounds like you are thinking ahead.
Be careful. Sometimes you sacrifice quality and end up paying more in replacements.
Are you finding good stuff to buy?
