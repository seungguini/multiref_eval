I love the dollar store.
That stuff is so low quality.
They have a lot of great stuff there. I buy from there all the time.
That's a good way to save on some things.
Nice, which dollar store are you going to?
Be careful. Sometimes you sacrifice quality and end up paying more in replacements.
How has that worked out for you?
Are you finding good stuff to buy?
