I love the dollar store.
That sounds reasonable.
They have a lot of great stuff there. I buy from there all the time.
That's a good way to save on some things.
Sounds like you are thinking ahead.
Nice, which dollar store are you going to?
That's a good way to pinch pennies.
How has that worked out for you?
