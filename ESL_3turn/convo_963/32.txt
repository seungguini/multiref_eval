I love the dollar store.
That sounds reasonable.
They have a lot of great stuff there. I buy from there all the time.
That's a good way to save on some things.
You'll end up spending more probably.
Sounds like you are thinking ahead.
Nice, which dollar store are you going to?
Are you finding good stuff to buy?
