I love the dollar store.
That stuff is so low quality.
That sounds reasonable.
They have a lot of great stuff there. I buy from there all the time.
That's a good way to save on some things.
Nice, which dollar store are you going to?
How has that worked out for you?
Are you finding good stuff to buy?
