I love the dollar store.
That stuff is so low quality.
They have a lot of great stuff there. I buy from there all the time.
You'll end up spending more probably.
Be careful. Sometimes you sacrifice quality and end up paying more in replacements.
That's a good way to pinch pennies.
How has that worked out for you?
Are you finding good stuff to buy?
