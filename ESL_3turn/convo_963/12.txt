I love the dollar store.
That stuff is so low quality.
That sounds reasonable.
They have a lot of great stuff there. I buy from there all the time.
That's a good way to save on some things.
Sounds like you are thinking ahead.
Be careful. Sometimes you sacrifice quality and end up paying more in replacements.
How has that worked out for you?
