I love the dollar store.
That stuff is so low quality.
That's a good way to save on some things.
You'll end up spending more probably.
Sounds like you are thinking ahead.
Be careful. Sometimes you sacrifice quality and end up paying more in replacements.
How has that worked out for you?
Are you finding good stuff to buy?
