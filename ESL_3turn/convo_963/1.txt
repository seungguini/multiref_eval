I love the dollar store.
That stuff is so low quality.
That sounds reasonable.
That's a good way to save on some things.
Nice, which dollar store are you going to?
Be careful. Sometimes you sacrifice quality and end up paying more in replacements.
That's a good way to pinch pennies.
Are you finding good stuff to buy?
