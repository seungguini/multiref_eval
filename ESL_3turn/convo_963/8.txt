That stuff is so low quality.
That sounds reasonable.
They have a lot of great stuff there. I buy from there all the time.
That's a good way to save on some things.
You'll end up spending more probably.
Be careful. Sometimes you sacrifice quality and end up paying more in replacements.
That's a good way to pinch pennies.
Are you finding good stuff to buy?
