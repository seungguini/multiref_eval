I love the dollar store.
That stuff is so low quality.
That sounds reasonable.
That's a good way to save on some things.
You'll end up spending more probably.
Be careful. Sometimes you sacrifice quality and end up paying more in replacements.
That's a good way to pinch pennies.
How has that worked out for you?
