The sign said the next two stops, so about 20 minutes.
It's probably a few miles ahead, should not be far.
We'll be there in no time.
It's after the next exit.
Exactly two miles.
I saw a sign before that said there is one on exit 52.
The next exit is one and a half miles away.
The next one is about 10 minutes away
