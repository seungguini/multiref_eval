The sign said the next two stops, so about 20 minutes.
We'll be there in no time.
It's after the next exit.
We are coming up to one.  It's on the next block.
I saw a sign before that said there is one on exit 52.
The next exit is one and a half miles away.
I see one coming up now.
The next one is about 10 minutes away
