The sign said the next two stops, so about 20 minutes.
Seven miles.
It's probably a few miles ahead, should not be far.
In a mile or so.  Not too far.
Exactly two miles.
We are coming up to one.  It's on the next block.
I saw a sign before that said there is one on exit 52.
I see one coming up now.
