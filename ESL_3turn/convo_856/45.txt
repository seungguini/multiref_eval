YA MEE TO HAVING CHECKING ACCOUNT
So a savings account then?
WHAT TYPE OF ACCOUNT DID YOU HAVING?
Well there's still savings, money market, and loan financing accounts.
You can always have another checking account.
I still have to ask.
What are you trying to do with your next account?
Do you have your ID?
