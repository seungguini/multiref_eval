I'll take the beer any day.
I prefer beer any day of the week,
I prefer both, but I probably smoke more.
Surely, you don't put beer and cigs in the same category. Cigarettes will kill you.
I can have beer anytime.
A cold beer is like so American, just like hot dogs.
I am allergic to beer.
Neither, I like to be healthy.
