I don't like either.
Surely, you don't put beer and cigs in the same category. Cigarettes will kill you.
A cold beer is like so American, just like hot dogs.
Not cigarettes! I can't stand the smell.
I am allergic to beer.
Neither, I like to be healthy.
I prefer beer.
I try to stay away from all drugs.
