Is that when you changed your major?
That makes sense.
Oh no, did you not study?
Sorry to hear it.
Oh I see, that explains it.
Dang, I'm sorry.
How did you manage to get a D in the course?
Can you retake the class?
Couldn't you have just taken it again?
Was the course too difficult?
Oh, you can't be a doctor with those grades.
Maybe you can retake the course for a better grade.
I can see how that's a problem.
