Maybe you should take a break.
What choice do you have?
Maybe it's time for you to find a different job.
Have some coffee.
I'm sure they would let you sit down.
You could always ask human resources if there's a job opening in a different department.
I'm feeling the same way today.
I can't afford to stop working.
