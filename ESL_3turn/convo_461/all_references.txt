Just a couple of more weeks and we'll have enough to get out of this place.
They work us too hard, that's for sure.
Maybe you should take a break.
What choice do you have?
Well what else are going to do?
Let's take a quick break.
Maybe it's time for you to find a different job.
The conditions here are terrible.
Have some coffee.
How much sleep did you get last night?
I'm sure they would let you sit down.
You could always ask human resources if there's a job opening in a different department.
Have you tried looking for something else?
I'm feeling the same way today.
I can't afford to stop working.
