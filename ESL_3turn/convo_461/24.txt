Just a couple of more weeks and we'll have enough to get out of this place.
They work us too hard, that's for sure.
Maybe it's time for you to find a different job.
The conditions here are terrible.
Have some coffee.
You could always ask human resources if there's a job opening in a different department.
Have you tried looking for something else?
I'm feeling the same way today.
