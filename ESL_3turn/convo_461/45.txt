Just a couple of more weeks and we'll have enough to get out of this place.
They work us too hard, that's for sure.
What choice do you have?
Maybe it's time for you to find a different job.
Have some coffee.
You could always ask human resources if there's a job opening in a different department.
I'm feeling the same way today.
I can't afford to stop working.
