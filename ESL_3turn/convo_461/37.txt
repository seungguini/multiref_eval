They work us too hard, that's for sure.
Maybe you should take a break.
Well what else are going to do?
The conditions here are terrible.
I'm sure they would let you sit down.
You could always ask human resources if there's a job opening in a different department.
Have you tried looking for something else?
I can't afford to stop working.
