Just a couple of more weeks and we'll have enough to get out of this place.
They work us too hard, that's for sure.
Maybe you should take a break.
What choice do you have?
Maybe it's time for you to find a different job.
The conditions here are terrible.
Have some coffee.
I'm sure they would let you sit down.
