Just a couple of more weeks and we'll have enough to get out of this place.
What choice do you have?
Maybe it's time for you to find a different job.
The conditions here are terrible.
I'm sure they would let you sit down.
You could always ask human resources if there's a job opening in a different department.
I'm feeling the same way today.
I can't afford to stop working.
