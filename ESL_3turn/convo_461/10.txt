Just a couple of more weeks and we'll have enough to get out of this place.
They work us too hard, that's for sure.
What choice do you have?
Well what else are going to do?
The conditions here are terrible.
Have some coffee.
How much sleep did you get last night?
Have you tried looking for something else?
