Just a couple of more weeks and we'll have enough to get out of this place.
They work us too hard, that's for sure.
Maybe you should take a break.
Maybe it's time for you to find a different job.
How much sleep did you get last night?
I'm sure they would let you sit down.
You could always ask human resources if there's a job opening in a different department.
Have you tried looking for something else?
