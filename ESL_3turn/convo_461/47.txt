Let's take a quick break.
Have some coffee.
How much sleep did you get last night?
I'm sure they would let you sit down.
You could always ask human resources if there's a job opening in a different department.
Have you tried looking for something else?
I'm feeling the same way today.
I can't afford to stop working.
