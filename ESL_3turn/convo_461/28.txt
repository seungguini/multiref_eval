Just a couple of more weeks and we'll have enough to get out of this place.
Well what else are going to do?
Maybe it's time for you to find a different job.
Have some coffee.
How much sleep did you get last night?
Have you tried looking for something else?
I'm feeling the same way today.
I can't afford to stop working.
