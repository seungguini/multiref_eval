Just a couple of more weeks and we'll have enough to get out of this place.
Maybe you should take a break.
The conditions here are terrible.
How much sleep did you get last night?

You could always ask human resources if there's a job opening in a different department.
Have you tried looking for something else?
I'm feeling the same way today.
