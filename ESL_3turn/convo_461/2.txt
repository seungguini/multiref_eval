Just a couple of more weeks and we'll have enough to get out of this place.
Well what else are going to do?
The conditions here are terrible.
Have some coffee.
How much sleep did you get last night?
You could always ask human resources if there's a job opening in a different department.
Have you tried looking for something else?
I'm feeling the same way today.
