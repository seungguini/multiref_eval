My shift is from 3 a.m. to 11 a.m.
That's nothing. Mine begins at 12 midnight.
At least you have the rest of your day available.
Yes, that is a pretty bad shift to cover.
That is pretty horrible.
I have 12pm to 5pm so my entire day is full.
Wow, why did you choose that shift?
Oh, that is a tough shift.
