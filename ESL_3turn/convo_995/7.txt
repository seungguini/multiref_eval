No, I think that there is ban on going out into the water right now.
Absolutely! I love swimming in the ocean!
Yes, I just a new pair of swim trunks.
Make sure you put on sunscreen first.
The ocean is so polluted.
I am afraid I might get sick
The smell of salt water is amazing.
I would love to jump in.
