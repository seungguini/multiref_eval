We are pretty booked, but it shouldn't be long.
Probably half an hour.  We are very busy tonight.
The wait time tonight is only 10 minutes.
We'll have your table ready in just a moment.
We have four other customers ahead of you.
There is only one party ahead of you, so ten minutes.
We are clearing a table right now.
We're very busy, so it could take up to an hour.
