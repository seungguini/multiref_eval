We are pretty booked, but it shouldn't be long.
It shouldn't be more than five minutes.
There is a wait of ten minutes.
Probably half an hour.  We are very busy tonight.
Half or hour or so.  You are welcome to sit at the bar.
It should only be a minute.
We are clearing a table right now.
We're very busy, so it could take up to an hour.
