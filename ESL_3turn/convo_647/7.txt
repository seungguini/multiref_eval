We are pretty booked, but it shouldn't be long.
It shouldn't be more than five minutes.
Probably half an hour.  We are very busy tonight.
We'll have your table ready in just a moment.
I'll get you in as soon as possible!
There is only one party ahead of you, so ten minutes.
It should only be one or two minutes.
We are clearing a table right now.
