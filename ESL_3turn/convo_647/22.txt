There is a wait of ten minutes.
We'll have your table ready in just a moment.
We have four other customers ahead of you.
Half or hour or so.  You are welcome to sit at the bar.
There is only one party ahead of you, so ten minutes.
It should only be one or two minutes.
We are clearing a table right now.
We're very busy, so it could take up to an hour.
