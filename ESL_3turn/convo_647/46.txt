We are pretty booked, but it shouldn't be long.
We'll have your table ready in just a moment.
Half or hour or so.  You are welcome to sit at the bar.
I'll get you in as soon as possible!
There is only one party ahead of you, so ten minutes.
It should only be a minute.
We are clearing a table right now.
We're very busy, so it could take up to an hour.
