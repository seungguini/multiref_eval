We are pretty booked, but it shouldn't be long.
It shouldn't be more than five minutes.
There is a wait of ten minutes.
The wait time tonight is only 10 minutes.
We'll have your table ready in just a moment.
Half or hour or so.  You are welcome to sit at the bar.
I'll get you in as soon as possible!
We're very busy, so it could take up to an hour.
