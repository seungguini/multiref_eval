We are pretty booked, but it shouldn't be long.
There is a wait of ten minutes.
We have four other customers ahead of you.
Half or hour or so.  You are welcome to sit at the bar.
There is only one party ahead of you, so ten minutes.
It should only be a minute.
We are clearing a table right now.
We're very busy, so it could take up to an hour.
