We are pretty booked, but it shouldn't be long.
It shouldn't be more than five minutes.
There is a wait of ten minutes.
Probably half an hour.  We are very busy tonight.
The wait time tonight is only 10 minutes.
There is only one party ahead of you, so ten minutes.
We are clearing a table right now.
We're very busy, so it could take up to an hour.
