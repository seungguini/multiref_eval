We are pretty booked, but it shouldn't be long.
There is a wait of ten minutes.
We'll have your table ready in just a moment.
Half or hour or so.  You are welcome to sit at the bar.
I'll get you in as soon as possible!
It should only be a minute.
We are clearing a table right now.
We're very busy, so it could take up to an hour.
