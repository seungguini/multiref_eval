We are pretty booked, but it shouldn't be long.
It shouldn't be more than five minutes.
There is a wait of ten minutes.
Probably half an hour.  We are very busy tonight.
We'll have your table ready in just a moment.
Half or hour or so.  You are welcome to sit at the bar.
I'll get you in as soon as possible!
There is only one party ahead of you, so ten minutes.
