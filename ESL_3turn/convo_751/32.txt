Friday would be nice and return in a week please.
I"d like to leave next Thursday.
Anytime between now and Friday is fine.
When would be the earliest flight?
I'm not particular, which day gives the best rate?
Which day is the cheapest?
How much is it for the flight?
Are there any flights out today?
