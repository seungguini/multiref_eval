Join a support group.
I will help you.
If you tell everyone your plan, we can all support your efforts.
Look at some pictures of smokers' lungs and then see if you have any willpower!
Have you tried nicotine gum or patches?
That's a pretty defeatist attitude to have.
You are strong.
We can work on it together.
