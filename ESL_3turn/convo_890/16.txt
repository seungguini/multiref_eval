Don't be silly. I'm sure you look great.
The pictures usually suck.
Wow, that really is a bad picture of you.
Why don't you like your picture?
I don't think it's possible to get a good picture.
Why didn't you brush your hair before taking it?
I hate my driver's license photo too.
I swear the DMV purposefully takes awful pictures of everyone.
