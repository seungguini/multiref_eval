You look great!
The pictures usually suck.
Why don't you like your picture?
I don't think it's possible to get a good picture.
Why didn't you brush your hair before taking it?
I hate my driver's license photo too.
They didn't let you retake it?
I swear the DMV purposefully takes awful pictures of everyone.
