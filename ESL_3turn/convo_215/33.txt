Prime rib.
I am waiting for my veggie pasta.
It's under the last name Rodriguez.
It's for a large pizza.
Their dish of the day.  Some kind a soup.
I ordered a hamburger, too.
I'm waiting on Jim's order. I'm going to take it back to him.
I am not waiting for anything.  I am here to keep him company.
