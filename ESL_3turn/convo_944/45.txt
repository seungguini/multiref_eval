Take the bus from Maywood to the midpoint.
It's the gray line.
You are going to take bus 29.
I'm not sure of the number, but it's the one from maywood to Corona.
Probably the one to fishburn.
I don't remember actually, just look at the route map.
I'm sorry, I don't work here.
If you wait around long enough I'm sure you'll find out.
