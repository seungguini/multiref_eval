It's the gray line.
You are going to take bus 29.
I'm not sure of the number, but it's the one from maywood to Corona.
Take the bus that leaves at 4 p.m.
Probably the one to fishburn.
Show me the busstops and i'll help you.
I'm sorry, I don't work here.
If you wait around long enough I'm sure you'll find out.
