You are going to take bus 29.
I'm not sure of the number, but it's the one from maywood to Corona.
Let's see the map.
It is the next one.
Take the bus that leaves at 4 p.m.
Show me the busstops and i'll help you.
I'm sorry, I don't work here.
If you wait around long enough I'm sure you'll find out.
