We give the utmost care to our customers.
Of course.
Just kidding. You shouldn't trust us.
We want to make sure everything is well and in order.
Is there anything else you're worried about?
If you're reassured by that, I have a bridge to sell you.
We'll treat it like it's our own.
Thank you for saying that.
