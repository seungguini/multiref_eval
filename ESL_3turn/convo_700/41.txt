This belonged to my grandmother. I would hate to see it damaged.
Of course.
Just kidding. You shouldn't trust us.
We want to make sure everything is well and in order.
Is there anything else you're worried about?
If you're reassured by that, I have a bridge to sell you.
We'll treat it like it's our own.
Do you have any other concerns?
