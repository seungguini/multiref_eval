Please tell me why you want to work here.
I trust you didn't have any difficulty finding my office.
I'll make this brief and painless don't worry.
Good morning to you, Angela.
Let me call the head of HR who will join us in this meeting.
This should only take a few minutes.
We were very impressed with your application and resume.
Can I offer you a cup of coffee before we begin?
