Let's start with an easy question. How did you hear about the job opening?
Did you bring your resume with you today?
I trust you didn't have any difficulty finding my office.
Good Morning Angela.
Let me call the head of HR who will join us in this meeting.
This should only take a few minutes.
We were very impressed with your application and resume.
Can I offer you a cup of coffee before we begin?
