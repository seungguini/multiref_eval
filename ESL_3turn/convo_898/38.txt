Please tell me why you want to work here.
Let's get started, make yourself comfortable.
I trust you didn't have any difficulty finding my office.
Good Morning Angela.
Good morning to you, Angela.
Let me call the head of HR who will join us in this meeting.
This should only take a few minutes.
Can I offer you a cup of coffee before we begin?
