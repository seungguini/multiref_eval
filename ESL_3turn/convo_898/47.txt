Let's get started, make yourself comfortable.
Did you bring your resume with you today?
I trust you didn't have any difficulty finding my office.
Good Morning Angela.
I'll make this brief and painless don't worry.
Make yourself comfortable and we will begin.
Good morning to you, Angela.
Can I offer you a cup of coffee before we begin?
