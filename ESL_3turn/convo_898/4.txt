Let's start with an easy question. How did you hear about the job opening?
Please tell me why you want to work here.
I trust you didn't have any difficulty finding my office.
Good Morning Angela.
I'll make this brief and painless don't worry.
Make yourself comfortable and we will begin.
Good morning to you, Angela.
Can I offer you a cup of coffee before we begin?
