Please tell me why you want to work here.
Did you bring your resume with you today?
I trust you didn't have any difficulty finding my office.
Good Morning Angela.
Make yourself comfortable and we will begin.
Let me call the head of HR who will join us in this meeting.
We were very impressed with your application and resume.
Can I offer you a cup of coffee before we begin?
