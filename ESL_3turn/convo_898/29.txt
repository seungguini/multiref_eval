Let's start with an easy question. How did you hear about the job opening?
Did you bring your resume with you today?
I trust you didn't have any difficulty finding my office.
I'll make this brief and painless don't worry.
Make yourself comfortable and we will begin.
Good morning to you, Angela.
We were very impressed with your application and resume.
Can I offer you a cup of coffee before we begin?
