Let's start with an easy question. How did you hear about the job opening?
Please tell me why you want to work here.
Let's get started, make yourself comfortable.
I trust you didn't have any difficulty finding my office.
Good Morning Angela.
Make yourself comfortable and we will begin.
Good morning to you, Angela.
Can I offer you a cup of coffee before we begin?
