Let's start with an easy question. How did you hear about the job opening?
Good Morning Angela.
I'll make this brief and painless don't worry.
Make yourself comfortable and we will begin.
Let me call the head of HR who will join us in this meeting.
This should only take a few minutes.
We were very impressed with your application and resume.
Can I offer you a cup of coffee before we begin?
