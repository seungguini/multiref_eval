Let's start with an easy question. How did you hear about the job opening?
Please tell me why you want to work here.
Did you bring your resume with you today?
I trust you didn't have any difficulty finding my office.
Good Morning Angela.
I'll make this brief and painless don't worry.
Let me call the head of HR who will join us in this meeting.
Can I offer you a cup of coffee before we begin?
