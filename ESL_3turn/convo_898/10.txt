Did you bring your resume with you today?
I trust you didn't have any difficulty finding my office.
Good Morning Angela.
I'll make this brief and painless don't worry.
Let me call the head of HR who will join us in this meeting.
This should only take a few minutes.
We were very impressed with your application and resume.
Can I offer you a cup of coffee before we begin?
