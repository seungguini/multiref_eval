Let's start with an easy question. How did you hear about the job opening?
Good Morning Angela.
I'll make this brief and painless don't worry.
Make yourself comfortable and we will begin.
Good morning to you, Angela.
Let me call the head of HR who will join us in this meeting.
This should only take a few minutes.
Can I offer you a cup of coffee before we begin?
