Let's start with an easy question. How did you hear about the job opening?
Let's get started, make yourself comfortable.
I trust you didn't have any difficulty finding my office.
Good Morning Angela.
Make yourself comfortable and we will begin.
Good morning to you, Angela.
Let me call the head of HR who will join us in this meeting.
Can I offer you a cup of coffee before we begin?
