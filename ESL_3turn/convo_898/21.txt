Let's start with an easy question. How did you hear about the job opening?
Please tell me why you want to work here.
Let's get started, make yourself comfortable.
Did you bring your resume with you today?
I trust you didn't have any difficulty finding my office.
Good Morning Angela.
Let me call the head of HR who will join us in this meeting.
Can I offer you a cup of coffee before we begin?
