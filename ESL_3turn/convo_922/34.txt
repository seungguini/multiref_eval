It doesn't matter, it's still going to cost you.
Sorry sir, it's policy and you still have to pay.
This is the minimum amount you can order. Sorry.
How many are you going to need?
If you went to the next level up, you would get free checks.
You have to purchase a minimum of 100 checks at a time.
What is your account number?
If you need just one or two I can supply you with them for free.
