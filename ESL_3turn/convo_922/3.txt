It doesn't matter, it's still going to cost you.
Sorry sir, it's policy and you still have to pay.
This is the minimum amount you can order. Sorry.
The smallest order is 500 checks.
How many checks do you need?
I understand, but we cannot sell you smaller amount.
If you went to the next level up, you would get free checks.
If you need just one or two I can supply you with them for free.
