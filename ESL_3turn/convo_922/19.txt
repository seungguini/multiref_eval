Sorry sir, it's policy and you still have to pay.
The smallest order is 500 checks.
How many checks do you need?
I understand, but we cannot sell you smaller amount.
If you went to the next level up, you would get free checks.
I see, do you know you can pay anyone from our online banking website?
What is your account number?
Tell me what you need and I'll try and get you the best deal.
