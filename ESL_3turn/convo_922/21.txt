It doesn't matter, it's still going to cost you.
Sorry sir, it's policy and you still have to pay.
This is the minimum amount you can order. Sorry.
How many are you going to need?
How many checks do you need?
You have to purchase a minimum of 100 checks at a time.
I see, do you know you can pay anyone from our online banking website?
If you need just one or two I can supply you with them for free.
