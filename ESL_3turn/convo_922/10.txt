Sorry sir, it's policy and you still have to pay.
This is the minimum amount you can order. Sorry.
How many checks do you need?
You have to purchase a minimum of 100 checks at a time.
I see, do you know you can pay anyone from our online banking website?
How many checks do you need? 100? 300?
Tell me what you need and I'll try and get you the best deal.
If you need just one or two I can supply you with them for free.
