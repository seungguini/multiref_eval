It doesn't matter, it's still going to cost you.
Sorry sir, it's policy and you still have to pay.
This is the minimum amount you can order. Sorry.
The smallest order is 500 checks.
I understand, but we cannot sell you smaller amount.
If you went to the next level up, you would get free checks.
I see, do you know you can pay anyone from our online banking website?
Tell me what you need and I'll try and get you the best deal.
