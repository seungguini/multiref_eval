Sorry sir, it's policy and you still have to pay.
This is the minimum amount you can order. Sorry.
The smallest order is 500 checks.
You have to purchase a minimum of 100 checks at a time.
How many checks do you need? 100? 300?
What is your account number?
Tell me what you need and I'll try and get you the best deal.
If you need just one or two I can supply you with them for free.
