Sorry sir, it's policy and you still have to pay.
This is the minimum amount you can order. Sorry.
How many are you going to need?
How many checks do you need?
If you went to the next level up, you would get free checks.
You have to purchase a minimum of 100 checks at a time.
I see, do you know you can pay anyone from our online banking website?
Tell me what you need and I'll try and get you the best deal.
