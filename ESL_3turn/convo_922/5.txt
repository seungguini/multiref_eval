Sorry sir, it's policy and you still have to pay.
How many checks do you need?
I understand, but we cannot sell you smaller amount.
If you went to the next level up, you would get free checks.
You have to purchase a minimum of 100 checks at a time.
I see, do you know you can pay anyone from our online banking website?
How many checks do you need? 100? 300?
What is your account number?
