Sorry sir, it's policy and you still have to pay.
This is the minimum amount you can order. Sorry.
The smallest order is 500 checks.
How many are you going to need?
I understand, but we cannot sell you smaller amount.
I see, do you know you can pay anyone from our online banking website?
Tell me what you need and I'll try and get you the best deal.
If you need just one or two I can supply you with them for free.
