It doesn't matter, it's still going to cost you.
Sorry sir, it's policy and you still have to pay.
The smallest order is 500 checks.
How many are you going to need?
I understand, but we cannot sell you smaller amount.
You have to purchase a minimum of 100 checks at a time.
Tell me what you need and I'll try and get you the best deal.
If you need just one or two I can supply you with them for free.
