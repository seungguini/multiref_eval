It doesn't matter, it's still going to cost you.
Sorry sir, it's policy and you still have to pay.
The smallest order is 500 checks.
How many are you going to need?
I understand, but we cannot sell you smaller amount.
What is your account number?
Tell me what you need and I'll try and get you the best deal.
If you need just one or two I can supply you with them for free.
