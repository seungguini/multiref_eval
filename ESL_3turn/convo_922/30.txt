It doesn't matter, it's still going to cost you.
Sorry sir, it's policy and you still have to pay.
How many checks do you need?
I understand, but we cannot sell you smaller amount.
You have to purchase a minimum of 100 checks at a time.
I see, do you know you can pay anyone from our online banking website?
Tell me what you need and I'll try and get you the best deal.
If you need just one or two I can supply you with them for free.
