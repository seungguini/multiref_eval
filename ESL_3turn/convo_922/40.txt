It doesn't matter, it's still going to cost you.
This is the minimum amount you can order. Sorry.
I understand, but we cannot sell you smaller amount.
You have to purchase a minimum of 100 checks at a time.
I see, do you know you can pay anyone from our online banking website?
How many checks do you need? 100? 300?
What is your account number?
If you need just one or two I can supply you with them for free.
