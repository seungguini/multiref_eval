It doesn't matter, it's still going to cost you.
This is the minimum amount you can order. Sorry.
I understand, but we cannot sell you smaller amount.
If you went to the next level up, you would get free checks.
You have to purchase a minimum of 100 checks at a time.
I see, do you know you can pay anyone from our online banking website?
How many checks do you need? 100? 300?
Tell me what you need and I'll try and get you the best deal.
