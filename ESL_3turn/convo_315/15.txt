They kind of look like bubbles in the tea.
What would you call it?
It's really little balls of tapioca, I think.
They are supposed to look like bubbles and give the tea its name.
Ofcourse, they do look like bubbles!
I think it's from China. I think you can eat the little balls on the bottom.
I shall start my own line of teas.
Maybe it means something else in Chinese.
