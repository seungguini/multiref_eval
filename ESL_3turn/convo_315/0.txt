What would you call it?
It's really little balls of tapioca, I think.
They are supposed to look like bubbles and give the tea its name.
Ofcourse, they do look like bubbles!
Gel tea, as these are very gummy.
I think it's from China. I think you can eat the little balls on the bottom.
Yeah, they look more like berries to me.
I will be your partner in this venture!
