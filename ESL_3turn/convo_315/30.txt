To me, either.
What would you call it?
It's really little balls of tapioca, I think.
They are supposed to look like bubbles and give the tea its name.
Ofcourse, they do look like bubbles!
Gel tea, as these are very gummy.
Maybe it means something else in Chinese.
I will be your partner in this venture!
