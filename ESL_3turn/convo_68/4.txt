I've never done this before.
Is it a complicated process?
Should I come to the office?
What kind of unemployment benefits do I receive?
How much will I make on unemployment?
That's good to hear, the situation isn't good right now.
What kind of forms do I have to fill out?
Do you know how much money I'll be making?
