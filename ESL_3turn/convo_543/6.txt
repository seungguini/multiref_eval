I'm not really interested in trying out.
Really? I didn't know that.
That was a different schools team.
How come when I asked the gym teacher she said there was no team?
I'll check with the Athletic Director about trying out for the team.
Oh that's awesome, my mistake.
That was the community tennis team.
I guess maybe it is new this year.
