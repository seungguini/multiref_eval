Are you making your famous potato salad?
I can't wait to try it for myself.
Marcia told me that the meal you made last month was amazing!
I hope you're bring your mac and cheese.
I'm sure you do a great job.
The party should be fun.
Your cooking will make the party even better.
Thank you for helping out with the party!
