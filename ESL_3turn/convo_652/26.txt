I can't wait to try your dessert!
Are you making your famous potato salad?
I can't wait to see what you make!
Marcia told me that the meal you made last month was amazing!
I hope you're bring your mac and cheese.
Looking forward to enjoying your food.
Your cooking will make the party even better.
Thank you for helping out with the party!
