I can't wait to try your dessert!
Are you making your famous potato salad?
I can't wait to try it for myself.
I can't wait to see what you make!
Marcia told me that the meal you made last month was amazing!
I'm sure you do a great job.
Looking forward to enjoying your food.
The party should be fun.
