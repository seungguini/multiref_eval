I can't wait to try your dessert!
Are you making your famous potato salad?
Marcia told me that the meal you made last month was amazing!
I hope you're bring your mac and cheese.
Looking forward to enjoying your food.
The party should be fun.
Your cooking will make the party even better.
Thank you for helping out with the party!
