Of course, you are the most suitable candidate anyway.
And to think I was just going to ask you to vote for me.
Of course!
Even if I didn't know you I would still vote for you!
Are the lines long?
I certainly am not voting for the other guy.
Anything for a friend.
I haven't even gone in to vote yet.
