You are a party pooper!
That's brutal.
So what? It's not that late.
Well have a good night.
Well I guess that makes sense then.
Bullshit, there are no classes at 7 a.m.
Come on, don't be a pansy.
Okay, grandma.
That's a crime against humanity.
Yea? And it's past your bed time?
Oh, come on, you can stay for another hour.
Big deal, I have to be at work at 6:30 a.m.
It's already too late to get a fully night's sleep, so might as well have fun.
Oh darn. Well get some rest then bud.
