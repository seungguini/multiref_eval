Well have a good night.
Well I guess that makes sense then.
Okay, grandma.
That's a crime against humanity.
Oh, come on, you can stay for another hour.
Big deal, I have to be at work at 6:30 a.m.
It's already too late to get a fully night's sleep, so might as well have fun.
Oh darn. Well get some rest then bud.
