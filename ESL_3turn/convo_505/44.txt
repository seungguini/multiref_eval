You are a party pooper!
So what? It's not that late.
Well I guess that makes sense then.
Come on, don't be a pansy.
That's a crime against humanity.
Yea? And it's past your bed time?
Big deal, I have to be at work at 6:30 a.m.
It's already too late to get a fully night's sleep, so might as well have fun.
