I have a salad for lunch every day.
That seems boring.
Why not have more variety?
I like to eat different kinds of foods each day, but I do eat three regular meals.
That's so dull. How do you not get bored?
I do miss ice cream though..
That must get so boring.
You don't ever wanna try anything new?
