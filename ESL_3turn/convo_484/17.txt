I have a salad for lunch every day.
You are a creature of habit.
That seems boring.
I don't understand how you don't get sick of it.
I like to eat different kinds of foods each day, but I do eat three regular meals.
That's so dull. How do you not get bored?
I do miss ice cream though..
You don't ever wanna try anything new?
