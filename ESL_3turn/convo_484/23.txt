I have a salad for lunch every day.
I am trying to loose some weight.
I don't understand how you don't get sick of it.
I like to eat different kinds of foods each day, but I do eat three regular meals.
I do miss ice cream though..
That must get so boring.
You don't ever wanna try anything new?
You're seriously weird.
