I know, my dogs were howling their heads off!
I was in my bed when it started.
i was right next to the window too.  It was scary.
We got underneath the table, it was really bad at my place.
Same here! Luckily nothing was bothered in my house.
That would be bad.
Last thing I need is glass everywhere.
It must have been like a 5.5.
