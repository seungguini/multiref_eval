I know, my dogs were howling their heads off!
I was in my bed when it started.
We got underneath the table, it was really bad at my place.
Same here! Luckily nothing was bothered in my house.
It's a good thing you weren't hit by anything falling on you.
Last thing I need is glass everywhere.
It was pretty bad.
It must have been like a 5.5.
