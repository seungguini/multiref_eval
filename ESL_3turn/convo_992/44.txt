I know, my dogs were howling their heads off!
I was in my bed when it started.
i was right next to the window too.  It was scary.
Same here! Luckily nothing was bothered in my house.
It's a good thing you weren't hit by anything falling on you.
That would be bad.
Last thing I need is glass everywhere.
It was pretty bad.
