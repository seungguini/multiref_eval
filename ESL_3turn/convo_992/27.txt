I know, my dogs were howling their heads off!
I can't believe it because we have never had an earthquake here!
I was in my bed when it started.
We got underneath the table, it was really bad at my place.
Same here! Luckily nothing was bothered in my house.
That would be bad.
Last thing I need is glass everywhere.
It was pretty bad.
