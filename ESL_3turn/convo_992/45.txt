I know, my dogs were howling their heads off!
I was in my bed when it started.
i was right next to the window too.  It was scary.
We got underneath the table, it was really bad at my place.
Same here! Luckily nothing was bothered in my house.
It's a good thing you weren't hit by anything falling on you.
It was pretty bad.
It must have been like a 5.5.
