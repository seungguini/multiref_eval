I can't believe it because we have never had an earthquake here!
I was in my bed when it started.
i was right next to the window too.  It was scary.
Same here! Luckily nothing was bothered in my house.
That would be bad.
Last thing I need is glass everywhere.
It was pretty bad.
It must have been like a 5.5.
