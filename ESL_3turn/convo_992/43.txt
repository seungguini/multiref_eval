I know, my dogs were howling their heads off!
I can't believe it because we have never had an earthquake here!
i was right next to the window too.  It was scary.
We got underneath the table, it was really bad at my place.
Same here! Luckily nothing was bothered in my house.
That would be bad.
It was pretty bad.
It must have been like a 5.5.
