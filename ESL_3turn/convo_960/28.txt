I hate to see you go.
Well you have to go where the work is.
But, there are plenty of great teaching jobs in California.
As much as I'd miss you, that sounds like a good opportunity.
How much are they paying you?
But it's so hot in Texas!
I never thought you would want to leave California.
Is it cheaper to live in Texas?
