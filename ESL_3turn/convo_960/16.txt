I hate to see you go.
Okay, well good luck with that.
But, there are plenty of great teaching jobs in California.
As much as I'd miss you, that sounds like a good opportunity.
Okay, I get it now.
How much are they paying you?
But it's so hot in Texas!
I never thought you would want to leave California.
