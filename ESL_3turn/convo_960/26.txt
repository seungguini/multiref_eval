Well you have to go where the work is.
As much as I'd miss you, that sounds like a good opportunity.
You're going to hate the weather in Texas.
Okay, I get it now.
How much are they paying you?
But it's so hot in Texas!
I never thought you would want to leave California.
You don't like your job here?
