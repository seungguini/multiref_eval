I hate to see you go.
Okay, well good luck with that.
But, there are plenty of great teaching jobs in California.
As much as I'd miss you, that sounds like a good opportunity.
I never thought you would want to leave California.
You don't like your job here?
Is it cheaper to live in Texas?
Is it a good job?
