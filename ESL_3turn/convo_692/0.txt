That must have been exciting for him.
What are they going for?
What part of the military did your dad serve in?
It'll be nice for him to see some old buddies.
Thank you dad for his service to this country.
What were they invited to?
Washington DC is a great place to visit, he should enjoy that.
Hopefully, he will meet some other men similar to him.
