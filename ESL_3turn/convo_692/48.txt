That must have been exciting for him.
What part of the military did your dad serve in?
Is he having a good time?
It'll be nice for him to see some old buddies.
What were they invited to?
I hope he has a nice time!
Washington DC is a great place to visit, he should enjoy that.
Hopefully, he will meet some other men similar to him.
