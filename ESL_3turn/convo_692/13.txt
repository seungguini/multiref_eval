That must have been exciting for him.
Thats cool!
That's exciting, when did your dad serve in the military?
Is he having a good time?
It'll be nice for him to see some old buddies.
Thank you dad for his service to this country.
What were they invited to?
Hopefully, he will meet some other men similar to him.
