That sounds fun!
That's exciting, when did your dad serve in the military?
What are they going for?
What did they do?
Thank you dad for his service to this country.
What were they invited to?
Washington DC is a great place to visit, he should enjoy that.
Hopefully, he will meet some other men similar to him.
