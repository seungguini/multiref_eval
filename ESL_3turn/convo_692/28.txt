That's exciting, when did your dad serve in the military?
What did they do?
Is he having a good time?
It'll be nice for him to see some old buddies.
Thank you dad for his service to this country.
What were they invited to?
Washington DC is a great place to visit, he should enjoy that.
Hopefully, he will meet some other men similar to him.
