That sounds fun!
What are they going for?
What part of the military did your dad serve in?
Is he having a good time?
Thank you dad for his service to this country.
I hope he has a nice time!
Washington DC is a great place to visit, he should enjoy that.
Hopefully, he will meet some other men similar to him.
