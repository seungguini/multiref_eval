That sounds fun!
That's exciting, when did your dad serve in the military?
What are they going for?
What part of the military did your dad serve in?
Is he having a good time?
It'll be nice for him to see some old buddies.
I hope he has a nice time!
Washington DC is a great place to visit, he should enjoy that.
