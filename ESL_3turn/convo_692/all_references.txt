That sounds fun!
That must have been exciting for him.
Thats cool!
That's exciting, when did your dad serve in the military?
What are they going for?
What did they do?
What part of the military did your dad serve in?
Is he having a good time?
It'll be nice for him to see some old buddies.
Thank you dad for his service to this country.
What were they invited to?
I hope he has a nice time!
Washington DC is a great place to visit, he should enjoy that.
Hopefully, he will meet some other men similar to him.
