We should go apply together.
I think I'm going to go apply.
I never realized hotels had that many employees.
Are you thinking of applying?
I'm not interested.
You should apply for a position!
Do you know if it's the hotel in downtown or the one by the harbor?
Maybe we could end up working together.
