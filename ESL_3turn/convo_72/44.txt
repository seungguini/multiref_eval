We should go apply together.
I think I'm going to go apply.
Are you thinking of applying?
You should apply for a position!
Do you know if it's the hotel in downtown or the one by the harbor?
Maybe we could end up working together.
I'm not interested in working in hospitality.
I wonder if the company pays their employees well.
