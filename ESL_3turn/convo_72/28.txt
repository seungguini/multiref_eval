We should go apply together.
I think I'm going to go apply.
I never realized hotels had that many employees.
Are you thinking of applying?
I'm not interested.
Do you know if it's the hotel in downtown or the one by the harbor?
Maybe we could end up working together.
I wonder if the company pays their employees well.
