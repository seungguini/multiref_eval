We should go apply together.
I'm telling my friends.
I never realized hotels had that many employees.
Are you thinking of applying?
I'm not interested.
Do you know if it's the hotel in downtown or the one by the harbor?
I'm not interested in working in hospitality.
I wonder if the company pays their employees well.
