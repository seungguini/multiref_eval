Wow, that's a lot of people.
We should go apply together.
I'm telling my friends.
You should apply for a position!
Do you know if it's the hotel in downtown or the one by the harbor?
Maybe we could end up working together.
I'm not interested in working in hospitality.
I wonder if the company pays their employees well.
