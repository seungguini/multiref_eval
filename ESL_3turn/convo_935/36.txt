I'm waiting on my appetizer.
I also ordered a medium steak with mashed potatoes.
I don't really know.  It's the house special.
I'm not getting anything else, I'm not very hungry tonight.
Something the waiter suggested.  A pasta dish.
I'm only waiting for my lemon water.
A pizza so we can share.
Just a drink.
