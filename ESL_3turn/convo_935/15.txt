I ordered the ribeye steak with a baked potato.
I don't really know.  It's the house special.
I'm waiting on my to go order.
I'm not getting anything else, I'm not very hungry tonight.
I ordered a potato soup as well.
Something the waiter suggested.  A pasta dish.
I'm only waiting for my lemon water.
Something delicious I hope.
