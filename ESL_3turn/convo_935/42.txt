I'm waiting on my appetizer.
I ordered the ribeye steak with a baked potato.
I also ordered a medium steak with mashed potatoes.
I don't really know.  It's the house special.
I'm waiting on my to go order.
I'm not getting anything else, I'm not very hungry tonight.
I ordered a potato soup as well.
A pizza so we can share.
