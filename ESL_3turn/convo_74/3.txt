You could look outside just as easily as me.
Why don't you look outside.
Why don't you?
Because I don't feel like getting up yet.
Fine, I'll look it up on my phone.
Maybe you should look since you're the one who wants to know.
Why can't you just tell me?
Well, you are right by the window and I'm not.
