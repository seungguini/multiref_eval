Why don't you look outside.
Because I don't feel like getting up yet.
I don't feel like getting out of bed.
Sure, I'll be looking at it.
Fine, I'll look it up on my phone.
Here, I'll just check the weather app on my phone.
Maybe you should look since you're the one who wants to know.
Why can't you just tell me?
