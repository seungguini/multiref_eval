You could look outside just as easily as me.
Why don't you look outside.
Because I don't feel like getting up yet.
Here, I'll just check the weather app on my phone.
Maybe you should look since you're the one who wants to know.
Why can't you just tell me?
Why are you always so difficult.
Well, you are right by the window and I'm not.
