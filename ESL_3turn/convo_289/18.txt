What are you going to buy yourself?
What are you going to do with it?
If I had that much money I'd save some and buy myself some new clothes.
What do you plan to do with that cash?
I wish they were my relatives.
Can I borrow some money?
Are they rich or something?
Is this what you get every birthday?
