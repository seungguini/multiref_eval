Food.
There is a menu in your bedside table.
Right now all we have is Pizza and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.
Did you want breakfast or dinner?
We have all sorts of things available to order.
We have a wide range of foods, everything from chicken salad to oribeyes.
If you look at our menu in the desk, you'll be able to see our offerings.
We are currently offering our soup of the day, which is clam chowder, or the chef's special which is filet mignon.
