Pfft. They say that a few times a week.
Well, that's rude.
I guess they've been doing a lot for us lately.
I guess that is fair
Why are we always selected, cant they hire a babysitter
Tell them that I already made plans
One day, we'll go on our own vacation without them!
should be fun if we order pizza
