Let me check on that for you.
Does this come in other colors?
Let me see if we have any in our stockroom.
Let me check in the back.
This one only comes in odd numbered-sizes. Would you like a nine?
Where are the fitting rooms?
I'll look into that for you.
Let me help you look.
Absolutely, let me go look.
I think we might have one left.
I don't actually work here. You should probably go ask at the counter.
Would a size ten work?
Size eights are on the bottom shelf.
Do you want it in that color?
