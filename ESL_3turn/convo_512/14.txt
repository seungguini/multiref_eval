Sure, what is that?
It depends what the favor is.
That depends, what is it?
I'm afraid no, I have a busy schedule today.
I owe you one.
Unfortunately I'm sort of busy right now. Maybe later?
No problem, what is it?
Only if it doesn't end up like the last favor you asked me. Painting is not my thing.
