Who are you going to invite?
That's a great place to hold a secret club.
That sounds kinda uncomfortable.
How much for the club dues?
You're not just trying to get me alone, are you?
What about my treehouse?
Maybe we can meet somewhere more comfortable?
If it's secret, how will anyone know about it?
