I suggest you focus on the experience rather than the material things.
Get some lingerie to wear for him.
Maybe plan a romantic getaway.
I'm a big believer in gift certificates.
He mentioned that he enjoys golfing.   Maybe you can buy some vouchers at his local golf course.
Give him a sexual coupon book.
Depends what he likes to do.
I'm not good at these kind of suggestions.
