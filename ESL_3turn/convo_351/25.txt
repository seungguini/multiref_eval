I suggest you focus on the experience rather than the material things.
I have no idea.
I use gift certificates for my husband.   That way he can get what he wants.
Get some lingerie to wear for him.
I'm a big believer in gift certificates.
Take him to a sporting event.
Something homemade is best.
Depends what he likes to do.
