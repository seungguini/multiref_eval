I suggest you focus on the experience rather than the material things.
I have no idea.
I use gift certificates for my husband.   That way he can get what he wants.
Maybe plan a romantic getaway.
He mentioned that he enjoys golfing.   Maybe you can buy some vouchers at his local golf course.
Something homemade is best.
Give him a sexual coupon book.
Depends what he likes to do.
