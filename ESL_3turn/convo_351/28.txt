I have no idea.
I use gift certificates for my husband.   That way he can get what he wants.
I'm a big believer in gift certificates.
Buy him season passes to his favorite sports team.
Something homemade is best.
Give him a sexual coupon book.
Depends what he likes to do.
I'm not good at these kind of suggestions.
