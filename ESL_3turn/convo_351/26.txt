I have no idea.
I use gift certificates for my husband.   That way he can get what he wants.
Maybe plan a romantic getaway.
He mentioned that he enjoys golfing.   Maybe you can buy some vouchers at his local golf course.
Take him to a sporting event.
Something homemade is best.
Depends what he likes to do.
I'm not good at these kind of suggestions.
