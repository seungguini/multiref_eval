I suggest you focus on the experience rather than the material things.
I have no idea.
I use gift certificates for my husband.   That way he can get what he wants.
Maybe plan a romantic getaway.
Buy him season passes to his favorite sports team.
Take him to a sporting event.
Depends what he likes to do.
I'm not good at these kind of suggestions.
