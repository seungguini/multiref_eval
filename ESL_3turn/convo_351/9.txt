I suggest you focus on the experience rather than the material things.
I have no idea.
I use gift certificates for my husband.   That way he can get what he wants.
Get some lingerie to wear for him.
Buy him season passes to his favorite sports team.
Take him to a sporting event.
Something homemade is best.
I'm not good at these kind of suggestions.
