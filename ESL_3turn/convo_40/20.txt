Alright, please remain calm. I'll get the doctor.
Response vehicles are on their way.
We need to get her back to an examination room then!
We'll get her in right now. Please stay here, and I'll be back with some paper work.
Can you describe what you see please?
What makes you think so?
Have you done anything to help her?
Is she breathing?
