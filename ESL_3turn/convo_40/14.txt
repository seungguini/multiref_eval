Have you called 911?
We need to get her back to an examination room then!
Oh no, what can I do to help?
We'll get her in right now. Please stay here, and I'll be back with some paper work.
I'll go and find the doctor.
What makes you think so?
Have you done anything to help her?
Why do you think that?
