Have you called 911?
Alright, please remain calm. I'll get the doctor.
Response vehicles are on their way.
We need to get her back to an examination room then!
Oh no, what can I do to help?
We'll get her in right now. Please stay here, and I'll be back with some paper work.
Can you describe what you see please?
I'll go and find the doctor.
What makes you think so?
What happened?
Have you done anything to help her?
Why do you think that?
Is she breathing?
