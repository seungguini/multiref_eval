Alright, please remain calm. I'll get the doctor.
Response vehicles are on their way.
We need to get her back to an examination room then!
We'll get her in right now. Please stay here, and I'll be back with some paper work.
I'll go and find the doctor.
What happened?
Have you done anything to help her?
Is she breathing?
