Lol of course you did.
You should start saving up for another iTunes card.
I've done that before!
I bet you're excited to listen to it!
I'll have to come over so I can listen with you.
Amazing how quickly you can go through the iTunes!
They're probably some of my favorite artists too.
I'm not buying you another card yet.
