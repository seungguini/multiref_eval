I heard that if you brush your hair too much it will cause split ends.
So what's the reason for your split ends, then?
Let me see how you do it.
That's probably the problem.
You could be doing it too forcefully.
You are being too rough with it.
What kind of conditioner do you use?
Do you use a relaxer?
