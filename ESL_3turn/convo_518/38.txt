I heard that if you brush your hair too much it will cause split ends.
So front to back, or back to front?
Let me see how you do it.
I'm not sure everyone does brush their hair the same.
Maybe you should go see a hair artist.
You could be doing it too forcefully.
You are being too rough with it.
Do you use a relaxer?
