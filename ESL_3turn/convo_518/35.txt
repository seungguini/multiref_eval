I heard that if you brush your hair too much it will cause split ends.
So what's the reason for your split ends, then?
Let me see how you do it.

I'm not sure everyone does brush their hair the same.
Maybe you should go see a hair artist.
You are being too rough with it.
What kind of conditioner do you use?
