I heard that if you brush your hair too much it will cause split ends.
So front to back, or back to front?
I know, but there are different techniques that help minimize split ends. That's why I asked.
I'm not sure everyone does brush their hair the same.
That's probably the problem.
You could be doing it too forcefully.
You are being too rough with it.
Do you use a relaxer?
