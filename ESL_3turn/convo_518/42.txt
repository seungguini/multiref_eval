I heard that if you brush your hair too much it will cause split ends.
So what's the reason for your split ends, then?
Let me see how you do it.
I'm not sure everyone does brush their hair the same.
That's probably the problem.
You could be doing it too forcefully.
You are being too rough with it.
Do you use a relaxer?
