I heard that if you brush your hair too much it will cause split ends.
So what's the reason for your split ends, then?
Let me see how you do it.
I know, but there are different techniques that help minimize split ends. That's why I asked.
Maybe you should go see a hair artist.
That's probably the problem.
You are being too rough with it.
Do you use a relaxer?
