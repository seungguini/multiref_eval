I heard that if you brush your hair too much it will cause split ends.
So front to back, or back to front?
So what's the reason for your split ends, then?
I know, but there are different techniques that help minimize split ends. That's why I asked.
Maybe you should go see a hair artist.
You are being too rough with it.
What kind of conditioner do you use?
Do you use a relaxer?
