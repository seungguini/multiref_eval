I heard that if you brush your hair too much it will cause split ends.
So front to back, or back to front?
So what's the reason for your split ends, then?
I know, but there are different techniques that help minimize split ends. That's why I asked.
I'm not sure everyone does brush their hair the same.
That's probably the problem.
You could be doing it too forcefully.
Do you use a relaxer?
