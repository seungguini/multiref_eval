Perhaps it's time to look for a new job.
But that's your only source of income.
What kind of job do you have?
Can you just treat them nicely?
Remember, the customer is always right!
Sounds like you should find a job you like.
Well, why don't you go work elsewhere?
I would, but i really need the money.
