Perhaps it's time to look for a new job.
What kind of job do you have?
Remember, the customer is always right!
Just make your patience a bit longer.
Sounds like you should find a job you like.
Well, why don't you go work elsewhere?
I wouldn't worry about it, as long as you're making good tips.
Aww, well that means you have to changer your perspective then.
