Perhaps it's time to look for a new job.
But that's your only source of income.
What kind of job do you have?
Can you just treat them nicely?
Remember, the customer is always right!
Well, why don't you go work elsewhere?
I would, but i really need the money.
Aww, well that means you have to changer your perspective then.
