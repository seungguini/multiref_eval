Perhaps it's time to look for a new job.
But that's your only source of income.
What kind of job do you have?
Can you just treat them nicely?
Just make your patience a bit longer.
Tell me more about it.
I would, but i really need the money.
I wouldn't worry about it, as long as you're making good tips.
