But that's your only source of income.
What kind of job do you have?
Can you just treat them nicely?
Just make your patience a bit longer.
I work as a car salesman, and customers are the most important thing there.
Sounds like you should find a job you like.
Aren't you exaggerating a little bit?
I would, but i really need the money.
