Perhaps it's time to look for a new job.
Can you just treat them nicely?
Remember, the customer is always right!
Just make your patience a bit longer.
I work as a car salesman, and customers are the most important thing there.
Sounds like you should find a job you like.
Well, why don't you go work elsewhere?
Aww, well that means you have to changer your perspective then.
