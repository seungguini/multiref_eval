Perhaps it's time to look for a new job.
But that's your only source of income.
Can you just treat them nicely?
Remember, the customer is always right!
Just make your patience a bit longer.
Sounds like you should find a job you like.
Well, why don't you go work elsewhere?
Aren't you exaggerating a little bit?
