Perhaps it's time to look for a new job.
But that's your only source of income.
What kind of job do you have?
Can you just treat them nicely?
Remember, the customer is always right!
Just make your patience a bit longer.
I work as a car salesman, and customers are the most important thing there.
Tell me more about it.
Sounds like you should find a job you like.
Well, why don't you go work elsewhere?
Aren't you exaggerating a little bit?
I would, but i really need the money.
I wouldn't worry about it, as long as you're making good tips.
Aww, well that means you have to changer your perspective then.
