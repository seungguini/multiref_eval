Perhaps it's time to look for a new job.
But that's your only source of income.
Just make your patience a bit longer.
I work as a car salesman, and customers are the most important thing there.
Aren't you exaggerating a little bit?
I would, but i really need the money.
I wouldn't worry about it, as long as you're making good tips.
Aww, well that means you have to changer your perspective then.
