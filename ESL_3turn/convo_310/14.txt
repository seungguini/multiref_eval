Perhaps it's time to look for a new job.
But that's your only source of income.
Can you just treat them nicely?
Tell me more about it.
Sounds like you should find a job you like.
Well, why don't you go work elsewhere?
I would, but i really need the money.
I wouldn't worry about it, as long as you're making good tips.
