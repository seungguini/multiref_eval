But that's your only source of income.
What kind of job do you have?
I work as a car salesman, and customers are the most important thing there.

Well, why don't you go work elsewhere?
Aren't you exaggerating a little bit?
I would, but i really need the money.
Aww, well that means you have to changer your perspective then.
