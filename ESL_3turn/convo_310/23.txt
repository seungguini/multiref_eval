Perhaps it's time to look for a new job.
But that's your only source of income.
Can you just treat them nicely?
Remember, the customer is always right!
Just make your patience a bit longer.
Sounds like you should find a job you like.
Aren't you exaggerating a little bit?
I wouldn't worry about it, as long as you're making good tips.
