Perhaps it's time to look for a new job.
What kind of job do you have?
Can you just treat them nicely?
Sounds like you should find a job you like.
Aren't you exaggerating a little bit?
I would, but i really need the money.
I wouldn't worry about it, as long as you're making good tips.
Aww, well that means you have to changer your perspective then.
