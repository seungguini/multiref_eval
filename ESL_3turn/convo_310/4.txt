Perhaps it's time to look for a new job.
What kind of job do you have?
Can you just treat them nicely?
Remember, the customer is always right!
Just make your patience a bit longer.
I work as a car salesman, and customers are the most important thing there.
Tell me more about it.
Sounds like you should find a job you like.
