Perhaps it's time to look for a new job.
What kind of job do you have?
Can you just treat them nicely?
Remember, the customer is always right!
Just make your patience a bit longer.
Well, why don't you go work elsewhere?
Aren't you exaggerating a little bit?
I wouldn't worry about it, as long as you're making good tips.
