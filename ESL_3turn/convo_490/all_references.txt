I know but you have to do it a certain way.
You should get an electric toothbrush.
And then do it all over again!
You have to do things to stay clean.
Maybe I'll invest in an electric toothbrush.
So repetitive.
I don't like the taste of many popular toothpastes.
I wish there was some contraption that could just do it for me.
