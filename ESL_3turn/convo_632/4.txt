The windshield is a structurally integral part of the car and will keep me safe.
Point taken. I'll make sure to put it on.
You're dropping me off in about 100 feet.
I've crashed before and the seat belt caused me to have a miscarriage.
I'll be fine. I don't need it.
You're right! I could get a ticket too!
That's true.  I will.
You sound just like my mother.
