Point taken. I'll make sure to put it on.
You're dropping me off in about 100 feet.
I've crashed before and the seat belt caused me to have a miscarriage.
I'll be fine. I don't need it.
Especially put it on if you're going to be driving down a dangerous highway.
You're right! I could get a ticket too!
That's true.  I will.
You sound just like my mother.
