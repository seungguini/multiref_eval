The windshield is a structurally integral part of the car and will keep me safe.
I don't want to.
Point taken. I'll make sure to put it on.
You're dropping me off in about 100 feet.
I've crashed before and the seat belt caused me to have a miscarriage.
I'll be fine. I don't need it.
You're right! I could get a ticket too!
You sound just like my mother.
