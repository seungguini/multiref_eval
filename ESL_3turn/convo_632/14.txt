The windshield is a structurally integral part of the car and will keep me safe.
I don't want to.
Point taken. I'll make sure to put it on.
I've crashed before and the seat belt caused me to have a miscarriage.
Especially put it on if you're going to be driving down a dangerous highway.
Okay. I'll put it on, but I'll just have to take it right back off.
You're right! I could get a ticket too!
You sound just like my mother.
