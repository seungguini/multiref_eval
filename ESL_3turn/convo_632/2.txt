The windshield is a structurally integral part of the car and will keep me safe.
Point taken. I'll make sure to put it on.
I've crashed before and the seat belt caused me to have a miscarriage.
I'll be fine. I don't need it.
Especially put it on if you're going to be driving down a dangerous highway.
You're right! I could get a ticket too!
That's true.  I will.
You sound just like my mother.
