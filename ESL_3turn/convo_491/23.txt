A night out at a Japanese restaurant.
The best way to start a perfect date is to be on time!
Okay then, I'll tell you.
A long hike in the woods.
A fancy restaurant.
A perfect date for me would have to be simple. No fancy restaurants, some fun game, looking at the stars at night, and
Dinner at a 5-star restaurant.
A date at the movies.
