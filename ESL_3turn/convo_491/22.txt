A night out at a Japanese restaurant.
A picnic on the beach.
The best way to start a perfect date is to be on time!
Okay then, I'll tell you.
A long hike in the woods.
A sunset picnic on the beach.
A perfect date for me would have to be simple. No fancy restaurants, some fun game, looking at the stars at night, and
A nice dinner at home.
