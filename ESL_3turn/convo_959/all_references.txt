Wouldn't that be a dream come true!
One can dream.
Then that would be bad for my diet.
One could only hope.
I wish they were!
ONly one way to find out.
Then they would melt when they rained!
I highly doubt that's the case.
Wouldn't that be something!
Maybe in your wildest dreams.
Everybody would want to touch them then!
I thought about that as a child.
