So what is the problem?
Sounds like a good problem!
And you can't decide which one to work at?
Which would you rather work at?
Can you take both jobs?
Can you work both of them - schedules work out?
Which one do you think would be a better job?
How does each one pay?
Which job do you like better?
Which one pays better?
Are leaning towards one or the other?
Congratulations on getting hired.
What do you think you will do?
