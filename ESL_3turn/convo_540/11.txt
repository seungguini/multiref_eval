He must throw a mean fastball!
Guess he should keep practicing.
How much will it cost to repair the window?
I've been there a few times when I was a kid.
It wasn't my window was it?
Good thing he wasnt practicing his hitting I guess.
When you play baseball these kinds of things happen.
Sounds like he needs to practice a little harder.
