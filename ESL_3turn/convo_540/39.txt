He must throw a mean fastball!
It happens.
Guess he should keep practicing.
So he thew a ball at it.
How much will it cost to repair the window?
Good thing he wasnt practicing his hitting I guess.
When you play baseball these kinds of things happen.
Sounds like he needs to practice a little harder.
