I've been under a lot of stress at work.
Is that something to worry about?
That's surprising, guess I'm getting old.
What are some things I can do to avoid going on drugs?
Is there anything that I can do to lower my blood pressure?
That's not too good.
I'm a little nervous about being at the doctor's.
Do I need to take any medications to lower my blood pressure?
