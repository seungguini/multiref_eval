I've been under a lot of stress at work.
What can I do to lower my blood pressure?
What are some things I can do to avoid going on drugs?
Is there anything that I can do to lower my blood pressure?
I'm a little nervous about being at the doctor's.
Is it dangerous?
Do I need to take any medications to lower my blood pressure?
What could cause that?
