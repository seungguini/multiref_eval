I've been under a lot of stress at work.
Yeah, I've been a bit stressed.
Probably because I've been under a lot of stress lately.
Is that something to worry about?
I'm a little nervous about being at the doctor's.
Is it dangerous?
Do I need to take any medications to lower my blood pressure?
What could cause that?
