I've been under a lot of stress at work.
Yeah, I've been a bit stressed.
Probably because I've been under a lot of stress lately.
Is that something to worry about?
That's surprising, guess I'm getting old.
Is there anything that I can do to lower my blood pressure?
That's not too good.
What could cause that?
