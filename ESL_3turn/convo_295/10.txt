I've been under a lot of stress at work.
Yeah, I've been a bit stressed.
Probably because I've been under a lot of stress lately.
What can I do to lower my blood pressure?
That's surprising, guess I'm getting old.
That's not too good.
I'm a little nervous about being at the doctor's.
Do I need to take any medications to lower my blood pressure?
