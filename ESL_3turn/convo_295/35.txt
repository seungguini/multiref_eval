Oh no!
Probably because I've been under a lot of stress lately.
Is that something to worry about?
That's surprising, guess I'm getting old.
High blood pressure runs in the family.
I'm a little nervous about being at the doctor's.
Do I need to take any medications to lower my blood pressure?
What could cause that?
