I've been under a lot of stress at work.
That's surprising, guess I'm getting old.
What are some things I can do to avoid going on drugs?
Is there anything that I can do to lower my blood pressure?
Can it be regulated?
I'm a little nervous about being at the doctor's.
Is it dangerous?
Do I need to take any medications to lower my blood pressure?
