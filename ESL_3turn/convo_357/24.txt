You might consider dressing up better for your interview.
Let me see what I can do.
Do you need a reference? I'd be happy to.
Would you like to do a mock interview with me for practice?
Do you want me to take a look at your resume and cover letters?
How many interviews have you gone on?
Who have you tried to meet with?
I'm sure if you keep trying you'll get one.
