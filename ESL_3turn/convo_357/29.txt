You might consider dressing up better for your interview.
Do you need a reference? I'd be happy to.
Would you like to do a mock interview with me for practice?
Do you want me to take a look at your resume and cover letters?
Who have you tried to meet with?
I'm sure if you keep trying you'll get one.
What are you looking for?
Just keep at it. Don't give up.
