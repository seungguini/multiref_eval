I've never known a boss who doesn't do that.
Ignore him and do your work.
Maybe you should talk to whoever is in charge of him.
Maybe you should talk to his supervisor.
Can you file a complaint?
That doesn't sound too bad.
well . is he rude to everyone equally or does he pick on you?
Yea, I've had a boss like that before. Makes life so much more stressful.
