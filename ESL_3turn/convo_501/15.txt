At you personally or just in general?
like actually yells? . or just talks forcefully
I've never known a boss who doesn't do that.
Define yells.
Maybe you should talk to his supervisor.
i hate bosses who yell
what does he do that's rude?
Yea, I've had a boss like that before. Makes life so much more stressful.
