At you personally or just in general?
like actually yells? . or just talks forcefully
Maybe you should talk to whoever is in charge of him.
i hate bosses who yell
what does he do that's rude?
That doesn't sound too bad.
well . is he rude to everyone equally or does he pick on you?
Yea, I've had a boss like that before. Makes life so much more stressful.
