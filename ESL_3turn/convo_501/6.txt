At you personally or just in general?
I've never known a boss who doesn't do that.
Ignore him and do your work.
What does he yell about?
Maybe you should talk to whoever is in charge of him.
Can you file a complaint?
That doesn't sound too bad.
well . is he rude to everyone equally or does he pick on you?
