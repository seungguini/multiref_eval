I've never known a boss who doesn't do that.
What does he yell about?
Maybe you should talk to whoever is in charge of him.
i hate bosses who yell
Can you file a complaint?
what does he do that's rude?
That doesn't sound too bad.
Yea, I've had a boss like that before. Makes life so much more stressful.
