At you personally or just in general?
like actually yells? . or just talks forcefully
I've never known a boss who doesn't do that.
Ignore him and do your work.
What does he yell about?
Maybe you should talk to his supervisor.
well . is he rude to everyone equally or does he pick on you?
Yea, I've had a boss like that before. Makes life so much more stressful.
