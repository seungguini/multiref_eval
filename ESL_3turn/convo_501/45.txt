At you personally or just in general?
like actually yells? . or just talks forcefully
I've never known a boss who doesn't do that.
Ignore him and do your work.
What does he yell about?
Maybe you should talk to whoever is in charge of him.
That doesn't sound too bad.
well . is he rude to everyone equally or does he pick on you?
