At you personally or just in general?
like actually yells? . or just talks forcefully
I've never known a boss who doesn't do that.
Ignore him and do your work.
What does he yell about?
Define yells.
Maybe you should talk to whoever is in charge of him.
Maybe you should talk to his supervisor.
i hate bosses who yell
Can you file a complaint?
what does he do that's rude?
That doesn't sound too bad.
well . is he rude to everyone equally or does he pick on you?
Yea, I've had a boss like that before. Makes life so much more stressful.
