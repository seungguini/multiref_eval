At you personally or just in general?
like actually yells? . or just talks forcefully
I've never known a boss who doesn't do that.
Ignore him and do your work.
Maybe you should talk to whoever is in charge of him.
Maybe you should talk to his supervisor.
what does he do that's rude?
Yea, I've had a boss like that before. Makes life so much more stressful.
