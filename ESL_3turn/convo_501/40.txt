At you personally or just in general?
I've never known a boss who doesn't do that.
What does he yell about?
Maybe you should talk to whoever is in charge of him.
Maybe you should talk to his supervisor.
what does he do that's rude?
That doesn't sound too bad.
Yea, I've had a boss like that before. Makes life so much more stressful.
