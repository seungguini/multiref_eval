like actually yells? . or just talks forcefully
I've never known a boss who doesn't do that.
Ignore him and do your work.
Define yells.
Maybe you should talk to whoever is in charge of him.
Can you file a complaint?
That doesn't sound too bad.
Yea, I've had a boss like that before. Makes life so much more stressful.
