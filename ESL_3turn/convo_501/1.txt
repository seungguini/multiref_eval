At you personally or just in general?
like actually yells? . or just talks forcefully
I've never known a boss who doesn't do that.
Maybe you should talk to whoever is in charge of him.
Maybe you should talk to his supervisor.
Can you file a complaint?
what does he do that's rude?
Yea, I've had a boss like that before. Makes life so much more stressful.
