At you personally or just in general?
I've never known a boss who doesn't do that.
Maybe you should talk to whoever is in charge of him.
Maybe you should talk to his supervisor.
i hate bosses who yell
Can you file a complaint?
well . is he rude to everyone equally or does he pick on you?
Yea, I've had a boss like that before. Makes life so much more stressful.
