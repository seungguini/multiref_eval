That would just interfere with my tv time.
Watching tv is my job.
But my shows are on!
I have one.  I'm on vacation.
I'd rather just watch T.V.
Right now, I'm focusing on self care.
You're probably right. I'm just very depressed.
How am I supposed to get a job when we live 50 miles from the nearest town?
