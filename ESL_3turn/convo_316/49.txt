I don't like to be x-rayed!
Do you know how long this is going to take?
Will they be able to tell me right away if it is broken?
Sure, there's no problem with me.
Not to worry young man, we are experts in healing legs.
What will the recovery be like if it is broken?
I can't believe I fell off the roof.
Thank you.
