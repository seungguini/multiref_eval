Will it be painful?
Do you know how long this is going to take?
Will they be able to tell me right away if it is broken?
Sure, there's no problem with me.
Can I get something for the pain first?
That is a relief, now time to take it easy and rest.
Is this going to hurt?
Sounds good to me, we will call you when its your turn to go in.
