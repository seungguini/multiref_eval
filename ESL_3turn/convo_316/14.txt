Will it be painful?
I don't like to be x-rayed!
oh man, i never thought that this would happen to me.
Will they be able to tell me right away if it is broken?
What will the recovery be like if it is broken?
Is this going to hurt?
Sounds good to me, we will call you when its your turn to go in.
I can't believe I fell off the roof.
