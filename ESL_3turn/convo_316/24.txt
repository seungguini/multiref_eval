I don't like to be x-rayed!
oh man, i never thought that this would happen to me.
Will they be able to tell me right away if it is broken?
Sure, there's no problem with me.
Can I get something for the pain first?
Is this going to hurt?
Sounds good to me, we will call you when its your turn to go in.
Thank you.
