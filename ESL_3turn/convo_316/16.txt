Will it be painful?
I don't like to be x-rayed!
oh man, i never thought that this would happen to me.
Do you know how long this is going to take?
Will they be able to tell me right away if it is broken?
Sure, there's no problem with me.
What will the recovery be like if it is broken?
That is a relief, now time to take it easy and rest.
