I don't like to be x-rayed!
Will they be able to tell me right away if it is broken?
Can I get something for the pain first?
What will the recovery be like if it is broken?
Is this going to hurt?
Sounds good to me, we will call you when its your turn to go in.
I can't believe I fell off the roof.
Thank you.
