Will it be painful?
Do you know how long this is going to take?
Will they be able to tell me right away if it is broken?
Not to worry young man, we are experts in healing legs.
Can I get something for the pain first?
What will the recovery be like if it is broken?
Sounds good to me, we will call you when its your turn to go in.
I can't believe I fell off the roof.
