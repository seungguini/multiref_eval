Will it be painful?
I don't like to be x-rayed!
oh man, i never thought that this would happen to me.
Do you know how long this is going to take?
Will they be able to tell me right away if it is broken?
What will the recovery be like if it is broken?
Sounds good to me, we will call you when its your turn to go in.
Thank you.
