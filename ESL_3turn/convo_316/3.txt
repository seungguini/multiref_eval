oh man, i never thought that this would happen to me.
Will they be able to tell me right away if it is broken?
Not to worry young man, we are experts in healing legs.
Can I get something for the pain first?
What will the recovery be like if it is broken?
That is a relief, now time to take it easy and rest.
Is this going to hurt?
Thank you.
