I don't like to be x-rayed!
oh man, i never thought that this would happen to me.
Sure, there's no problem with me.
That is a relief, now time to take it easy and rest.
Is this going to hurt?
Sounds good to me, we will call you when its your turn to go in.
I can't believe I fell off the roof.
Thank you.
