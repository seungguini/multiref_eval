Will it be painful?
I don't like to be x-rayed!
oh man, i never thought that this would happen to me.
Will they be able to tell me right away if it is broken?
Can I get something for the pain first?
What will the recovery be like if it is broken?
That is a relief, now time to take it easy and rest.
Sounds good to me, we will call you when its your turn to go in.
