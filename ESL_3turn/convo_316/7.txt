Will it be painful?
oh man, i never thought that this would happen to me.
Do you know how long this is going to take?
Will they be able to tell me right away if it is broken?
Sure, there's no problem with me.
What will the recovery be like if it is broken?
Is this going to hurt?
I can't believe I fell off the roof.
