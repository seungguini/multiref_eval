Will it be painful?
oh man, i never thought that this would happen to me.
Do you know how long this is going to take?
Can I get something for the pain first?
What will the recovery be like if it is broken?
Is this going to hurt?
Sounds good to me, we will call you when its your turn to go in.
I can't believe I fell off the roof.
