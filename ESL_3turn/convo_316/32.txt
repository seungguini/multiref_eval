Do you know how long this is going to take?
Will they be able to tell me right away if it is broken?
Sure, there's no problem with me.
Can I get something for the pain first?
What will the recovery be like if it is broken?
Is this going to hurt?
Sounds good to me, we will call you when its your turn to go in.
Thank you.
