I don't like to be x-rayed!
Do you know how long this is going to take?
Sure, there's no problem with me.
Can I get something for the pain first?
That is a relief, now time to take it easy and rest.
Sounds good to me, we will call you when its your turn to go in.
I can't believe I fell off the roof.
Thank you.
