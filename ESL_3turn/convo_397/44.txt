Seriously? Did you actually run into her?
Which street were you on when you two met?
Literally? Or figuratively?
What did you all say?
Have you seen her on campus before?
Where are you two going for your date?
That's a cool way to meet. Maybe you'll tell the story to your kids some day.
What kind of girl is she?
