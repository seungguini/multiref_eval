What is she like?
Seriously? Did you actually run into her?
Which street were you on when you two met?
Literally? Or figuratively?
What did you all say?
What is her name?
I would have loved to have heard that conversation!
That's a cool way to meet. Maybe you'll tell the story to your kids some day.
