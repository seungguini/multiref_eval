Seriously? Did you actually run into her?
Which street were you on when you two met?
Literally? Or figuratively?
What did you all say?
I would have loved to have heard that conversation!
Where are you two going for your date?
That's a cool way to meet. Maybe you'll tell the story to your kids some day.
Does she have any friends you can hook me up with?
