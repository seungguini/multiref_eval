I hope not with your car!
What is she like?
Seriously? Did you actually run into her?
Which street were you on when you two met?
Literally? Or figuratively?
What did you all say?
Have you seen her on campus before?
What is her name?
I would have loved to have heard that conversation!
Where are you two going for your date?
That's a cool way to meet. Maybe you'll tell the story to your kids some day.
Does she have any friends you can hook me up with?
What kind of girl is she?
