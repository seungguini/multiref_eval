Seriously? Did you actually run into her?
Literally? Or figuratively?
What is her name?
I would have loved to have heard that conversation!
Where are you two going for your date?
That's a cool way to meet. Maybe you'll tell the story to your kids some day.
Does she have any friends you can hook me up with?
What kind of girl is she?
