The place where freshman can eat all they want.

All-you-can-eat is deadly.
It's totally common. Between the lack of parents to dictate diet and often the partying, many first time students get it.

It's a normal phenomenon for freshman college students. It's not always fifteen pounds, but most people gain some weight because of poor diet during college.
