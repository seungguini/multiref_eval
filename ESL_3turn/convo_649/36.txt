Freshmen love it
Everyone gains 15 pounds after freshman year.
It's called that because that's when most freshment gain weight; I did.
It is mostly carbs.
All-you-can-eat is deadly.
It's totally common. Between the lack of parents to dictate diet and often the partying, many first time students get it.
That's horrible.  I am sure the stress doesn't help.
I think you already found out what it is. Don't worry, I did, too, in my first year.
