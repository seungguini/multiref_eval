The place where freshman can eat all they want.
Freshmen love it
Everyone gains 15 pounds after freshman year.
It's called that because that's when most freshment gain weight; I did.
It is mostly carbs.
It's totally common. Between the lack of parents to dictate diet and often the partying, many first time students get it.
I think you already found out what it is. Don't worry, I did, too, in my first year.
It's a normal phenomenon for freshman college students. It's not always fifteen pounds, but most people gain some weight because of poor diet during college.
