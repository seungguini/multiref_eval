Didn't you hear the announcements?
Were you drunk?
You probably shouldn't drink so much if you're waiting for a flight.
You can grab a hotel by the airport and stay till tommorow and get a flight out in the morning.
Are you going to take a later flight?
I've done that before.
Maybe you shouldn't have been at the bar.
Did you have a difficult time getting a new flight?
