I am sure there is another flight you can take, did you check the schedule?
Didn't you hear the announcements?
Were you drunk?
You probably shouldn't drink so much if you're waiting for a flight.
You can grab a hotel by the airport and stay till tommorow and get a flight out in the morning.
Are you going to take a later flight?
Understandable, that's happened to me before.
Did you have a difficult time getting a new flight?
