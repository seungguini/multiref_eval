I am sure there is another flight you can take, did you check the schedule?
Were you drunk?
You probably shouldn't drink so much if you're waiting for a flight.
You can grab a hotel by the airport and stay till tommorow and get a flight out in the morning.
Are you going to take a later flight?
I've done that before.
Understandable, that's happened to me before.
Maybe you shouldn't have been at the bar.
