Why would someone want a committee to vote for them?
I think that's unfair especially if I have different beliefs than theirs.
Why would anyone allow for that?
That sounds terrible.
Doesn't it have something to do with the mail?
If I voted for those representatives, then I think that's fine.
I've never heard of that.
I hate that too.
