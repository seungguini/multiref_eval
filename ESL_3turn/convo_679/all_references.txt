Their songs never get old.
Yes their songs are classic.
I have all of their albums!
Which song is your favorite?
They are the most admired group of all time.
I listen to their albums every day.
My mom used to date John!
It's hard to go wrong with The Beatles!
I wish I could have seen them in concert.
Paul is such a hunk!
I'm going to download all of their albums this weekend.
I wasn't thrilled with the YOKo songs were you?
You must be the youngest fan I've met.
