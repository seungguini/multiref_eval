I have all of their albums!
They are the most admired group of all time.
I listen to their albums every day.
My mom used to date John!
I wish I could have seen them in concert.
Paul is such a hunk!
I'm going to download all of their albums this weekend.
I wasn't thrilled with the YOKo songs were you?
