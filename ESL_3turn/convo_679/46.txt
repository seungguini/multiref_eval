Their songs never get old.
I have all of their albums!
Which song is your favorite?
They are the most admired group of all time.
I wish I could have seen them in concert.
I'm going to download all of their albums this weekend.
I wasn't thrilled with the YOKo songs were you?
You must be the youngest fan I've met.
