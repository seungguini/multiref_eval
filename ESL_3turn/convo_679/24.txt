I have all of their albums!
They are the most admired group of all time.
I listen to their albums every day.
It's hard to go wrong with The Beatles!
I wish I could have seen them in concert.
I'm going to download all of their albums this weekend.
I wasn't thrilled with the YOKo songs were you?
You must be the youngest fan I've met.
