I have all of their albums!
Which song is your favorite?
They are the most admired group of all time.
My mom used to date John!
It's hard to go wrong with The Beatles!
I wish I could have seen them in concert.
I'm going to download all of their albums this weekend.
I wasn't thrilled with the YOKo songs were you?
