CARPOOL IS BETTER THAT DRIVING
Of course it is!
Whose car do you want to take?
We can save gas.
YOUR IDEA SOUNDS GOOD.
Do you have a car we can take?
We can take my car if you want.
It's less stressful.
Want to find more people to join us?
Would you like some gas money?
We'll be helping the environment.
I thought so too.
It's the responsible thing to do.
I just knew you would agree.
Everyone drives in LA. So many people drive alone.
