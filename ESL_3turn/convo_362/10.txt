That's awesome, what makes you want to move to the city?
Why do you say of course?
Hope you have some money saved up.
The city is awesome, but be sure to save your money. It's expensive.
Have you ever been there?
What will you do there for work?
Oh, silly me, of course you meant the city.
I guess that was a stupid question.
