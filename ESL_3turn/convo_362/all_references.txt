That's awesome, what makes you want to move to the city?
I heard it's dirty there.
Why do you say of course?
Hope you have some money saved up.
The city is awesome, but be sure to save your money. It's expensive.
Have you ever been there?
That's not a dumb question.
What will you do there for work?
A lot of people move to places like Rochester and Buffalo.
Oh, silly me, of course you meant the city.
I guess that was a stupid question.
The city isn't that great!
That sounds exciting.
Which borough?
