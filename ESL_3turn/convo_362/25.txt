That's awesome, what makes you want to move to the city?
I heard it's dirty there.
Why do you say of course?
The city is awesome, but be sure to save your money. It's expensive.
What will you do there for work?
A lot of people move to places like Rochester and Buffalo.
I guess that was a stupid question.
The city isn't that great!
