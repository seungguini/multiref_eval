That's awesome, what makes you want to move to the city?
The city is awesome, but be sure to save your money. It's expensive.
Have you ever been there?

A lot of people move to places like Rochester and Buffalo.
Oh, silly me, of course you meant the city.
I guess that was a stupid question.
Which borough?
