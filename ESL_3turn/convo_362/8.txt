That's awesome, what makes you want to move to the city?
I heard it's dirty there.
Why do you say of course?
Hope you have some money saved up.
The city is awesome, but be sure to save your money. It's expensive.
That's not a dumb question.
Oh, silly me, of course you meant the city.
I guess that was a stupid question.
