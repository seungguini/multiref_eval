That's awesome, what makes you want to move to the city?
I heard it's dirty there.
Why do you say of course?
Hope you have some money saved up.
The city is awesome, but be sure to save your money. It's expensive.
A lot of people move to places like Rochester and Buffalo.
The city isn't that great!
That sounds exciting.
