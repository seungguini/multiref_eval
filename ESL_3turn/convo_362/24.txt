That's awesome, what makes you want to move to the city?
I heard it's dirty there.
Why do you say of course?
The city is awesome, but be sure to save your money. It's expensive.
Have you ever been there?
What will you do there for work?
A lot of people move to places like Rochester and Buffalo.
I guess that was a stupid question.
