Okay, would you like it a couple inches longer then?
Okay, I can definitely take a little more off this time!
We can make it shorter.
How much longer were you thinking?
I can do shorter layers this time.
Would you like me to use a smaller blade for a closer cut?
What length did you have in mind?
Do you want to look a few pictures to get some ideas?
