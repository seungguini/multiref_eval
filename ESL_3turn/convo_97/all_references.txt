Okay, would you like it a couple inches longer then?
Okay, I can definitely take a little more off this time!
We can make it shorter.
So you would like it shorter?
How much longer were you thinking?
Oh I'm sorry about that, I'll cut it exactly how you want this time!
I can do shorter layers this time.
Would you like me to use a smaller blade for a closer cut?
What length did you have in mind?
Do you want to look a few pictures to get some ideas?
Did you want to keep it below your shoulders?
