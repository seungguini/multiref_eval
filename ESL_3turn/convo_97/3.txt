Okay, would you like it a couple inches longer then?
So you would like it shorter?
How much longer were you thinking?
Oh I'm sorry about that, I'll cut it exactly how you want this time!
I can do shorter layers this time.
Would you like me to use a smaller blade for a closer cut?
What length did you have in mind?
Do you want to look a few pictures to get some ideas?
