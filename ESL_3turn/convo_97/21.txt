Okay, would you like it a couple inches longer then?
Okay, I can definitely take a little more off this time!
How much longer were you thinking?
Oh I'm sorry about that, I'll cut it exactly how you want this time!
I can do shorter layers this time.
Would you like me to use a smaller blade for a closer cut?
What length did you have in mind?
Did you want to keep it below your shoulders?
