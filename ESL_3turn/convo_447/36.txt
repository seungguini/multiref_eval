Not really.
You're right, there's too much drama and sadness on Facebook.
It's definitely a huge time waster.
Facebook is a great place to stay in touch with family and friends, but it gets boring after a while.
There are definitely better things you can do with your time.
I deleted my Facebook a while ago.
It's probably for the best.
I hate Facebook.
