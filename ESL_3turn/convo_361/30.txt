Yes, she clutching her chest and having a hard time breathing
Her speech is slurred.
She's hold her left arm and screaming in pain
I'm not sure, she collapsed holding her shoulder.
No I can't.
Her face is drooping.
She's not responding when I speak to her!
She isn't making any sense when I ask her questions.
