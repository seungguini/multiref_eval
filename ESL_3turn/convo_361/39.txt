Yes, she clutching her chest and having a hard time breathing
She's hold her left arm and screaming in pain
I'm not sure, she collapsed holding her shoulder.
Her face is drooping.
I'm sorry I'm panicking.
Hurry please send help.
She's very overweight.
She isn't making any sense when I ask her questions.
