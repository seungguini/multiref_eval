Yes, she clutching her chest and having a hard time breathing
Just send an ambulance right away.
Her speech is slurred.
She's hold her left arm and screaming in pain
I'm not sure, she collapsed holding her shoulder.
No I can't.
She's not responding when I speak to her!
She isn't making any sense when I ask her questions.
