Yes, she clutching her chest and having a hard time breathing
Just send an ambulance right away.
She's hold her left arm and screaming in pain
Her face is drooping.
She can't lift her arms.
Hurry please send help.
She's not responding when I speak to her!
She isn't making any sense when I ask her questions.
