Pain in the left arm and chest.
Just send an ambulance right away.
Her speech is slurred.
She's hold her left arm and screaming in pain
I'm not sure, she collapsed holding her shoulder.
No I can't.
Her face is drooping.
I'm sorry I'm panicking.
She can't lift her arms.
Hurry please send help.
She's not responding when I speak to her!
She's very overweight.
She isn't making any sense when I ask her questions.
