Anything but Democrat.
For Trump, of course.
I think i'm going to vote republican.
I don't share that information with anyone.
For whoever isn't forcing vaccines on the public.
I'm going to send it in the mail.
I'm heading down to the town hall later.
I'm sorry but I really don't like discussing that with people.
