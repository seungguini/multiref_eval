I am unsure how I am going to vote.
By mail.
I think i'm going to vote republican.
For whoever isn't forcing vaccines on the public.
I'm going to send it in the mail.
I decided how to vote after learning more about the candidates and issues.
I'm heading down to the town hall later.
I'm sorry but I really don't like discussing that with people.
