I heard a report that said closer to 45.
Wow that's awful.
That's horrible.
Yes, and I think a few people died from it.
And I think something like 1000 people were evaculated.
Really? I heard it was only 10 houses.
Friggin' global warming.
And it could have been a lot worse if they hadn't put it out in time.
