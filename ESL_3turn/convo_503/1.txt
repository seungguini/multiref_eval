I heard a report that said closer to 45.
Wow that's awful.
I heard 20, but yeah, it was pretty bad.
I can't believe that. It's so terrible.
And I think something like 1000 people were evaculated.
Really? I heard it was only 10 houses.
And it could have been a lot worse if they hadn't put it out in time.
I hope nobody got hurt.
