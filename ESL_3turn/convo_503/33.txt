Yeah, I heard that.
Wow that's awful.
Yes, and I think a few people died from it.
I hope there are no injuries.
And I think something like 1000 people were evaculated.
Friggin' global warming.
And it could have been a lot worse if they hadn't put it out in time.
I wonder if P.G.&E set this one too.
