I heard a report that said closer to 45.
I heard 20, but yeah, it was pretty bad.
I can't believe that. It's so terrible.
I hope there are no injuries.
Really? I heard it was only 10 houses.
And it could have been a lot worse if they hadn't put it out in time.
I wonder if P.G.&E set this one too.
I hope nobody got hurt.
