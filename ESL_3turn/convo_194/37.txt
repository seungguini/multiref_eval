I had Italian last night, so no pizza or spaghetti.
Let's go to McDonald's.
Anyplace cheap and casual.
Somewhere quiet for once.
Let's go somewhere where we don't have to change clothes.
How about the new place at the corner of 5th and Main?
Wherever you want.
How about the new burger place downtown?
