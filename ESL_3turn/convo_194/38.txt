I feel like Italian tonight.
I had Italian last night, so no pizza or spaghetti.
Let's go to McDonald's.
Somewhere quiet for once.
How about a great big steak and baked potato?
I feel like a classier joint.
Let's go somewhere where we don't have to change clothes.
How about the new burger place downtown?
