I feel like Italian tonight.
Anyplace cheap and casual.
How about a great big steak and baked potato?
Where do you want to go?
Let's go somewhere where we don't have to change clothes.
How about the new place at the corner of 5th and Main?
How about the new burger place downtown?
Should we get sushi?
