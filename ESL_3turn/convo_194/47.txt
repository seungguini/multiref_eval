I had Italian last night, so no pizza or spaghetti.
Somewhere quiet for once.
How about a great big steak and baked potato?
Where do you want to go?
I feel like a classier joint.
Let's go somewhere where we don't have to change clothes.
How about the new place at the corner of 5th and Main?
How about the new burger place downtown?
