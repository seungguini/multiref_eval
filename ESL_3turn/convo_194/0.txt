I had Italian last night, so no pizza or spaghetti.
Anyplace cheap and casual.
How about a great big steak and baked potato?
I feel like a classier joint.
Let's go somewhere where we don't have to change clothes.
How about across the street?
How about the new place at the corner of 5th and Main?
Should we get sushi?
