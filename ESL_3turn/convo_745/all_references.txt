Of course, he could have seriously injured someone.
We can, but I didn't catch the license plate number.
Just let him go.
Yeah, but what good would it do?
We could, but we have other things to worry about.
Yes, he could've killed someone.
I didn't get his license plate.
Yes, call them now.
Nah, that's not our job.
It's possible that he's drunk, it would be smart to call the police in case he hurts someone.
