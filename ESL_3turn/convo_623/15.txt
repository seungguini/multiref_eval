I don't mind the drive, it is a beautiful drive.
I'll leave early and take lots of breaks.
We can listen to music the whole trip.
True, but it's very pretty along the highway.
The time will fly by.
Maybe we should go when we have more time.
I know, but I really want to see Seattle.
That's not that far a drive.
