I don't mind the drive, it is a beautiful drive.
I'll leave early and take lots of breaks.
We can listen to music the whole trip.
We could go to Portland instead.
We can split the drive and that will make it easier.
Maybe we should go when we have more time.
I know, but I really want to see Seattle.
That's not that far a drive.
