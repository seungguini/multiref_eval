I don't mind the drive, it is a beautiful drive.
I'll leave early and take lots of breaks.
We can listen to music the whole trip.
We could go to Portland instead.
True, but it's very pretty along the highway.
Maybe we should go when we have more time.
That's not that far a drive.
That's still a one day drive, so I can drive the whole time if you want.
