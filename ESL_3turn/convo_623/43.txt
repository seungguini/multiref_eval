I don't mind the drive, it is a beautiful drive.
I'll leave early and take lots of breaks.
We could go to Portland instead.
We can split the drive and that will make it easier.
True, but it's very pretty along the highway.
Maybe we should go when we have more time.
I know, but I really want to see Seattle.
That's still a one day drive, so I can drive the whole time if you want.
