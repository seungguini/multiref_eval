I don't mind the drive, it is a beautiful drive.
I'll leave early and take lots of breaks.
We can listen to music the whole trip.
We could go to Portland instead.
True, but it's very pretty along the highway.
The time will fly by.
I know, but I really want to see Seattle.
That's still a one day drive, so I can drive the whole time if you want.
