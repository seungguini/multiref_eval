I don't mind the drive, it is a beautiful drive.
We can listen to music the whole trip.
We could go to Portland instead.
We can split the drive and that will make it easier.
Maybe we should go when we have more time.
I know, but I really want to see Seattle.
That's not that far a drive.
That's still a one day drive, so I can drive the whole time if you want.
