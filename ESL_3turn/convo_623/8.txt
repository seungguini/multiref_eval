I don't mind the drive, it is a beautiful drive.
I'll leave early and take lots of breaks.
We could go to Portland instead.
True, but it's very pretty along the highway.
The time will fly by.
I know, but I really want to see Seattle.
That's not that far a drive.
That's still a one day drive, so I can drive the whole time if you want.
