I agree!
It's looking better for sure.
I'm willing to pay more for my peace of mind.
Means I will work a second job but it will be worth it.
I didn't really want to go higher, but it's worth it.
I'm not happy about the price, is there a way we can work out a solution?
Did you see how many windows there are?
I'm so excited to be moving there!
