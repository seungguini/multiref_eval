Ok, here are some brochures to look at.
In that case, I have a map that you can use for free.
What if I upgraded your ticket to a VIP experience?
Your best bet is to head downtown.
I understand that tours aren't for everyone.
That's a good idea.
Be sure to check out the museum down the street.
That sounds like fun.
