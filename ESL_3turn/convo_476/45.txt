Ok, here are some brochures to look at.
The tour only lasts an hour.  You will have time to explore it on your own afterwards.
I can give you some suggestions.
In that case, I have a map that you can use for free.
What if I upgraded your ticket to a VIP experience?
I can give you some recommendations for places to see.
That's a good idea.
Enjoy the sights and sounds of this great city.
