I can give you some suggestions.
In that case, I have a map that you can use for free.
If you visit the chamber of commerce site, it gives tourist information.
A lot of people like to do that.
Your best bet is to head downtown.
I understand that tours aren't for everyone.
That's what I like to do too.
That sounds like fun.
