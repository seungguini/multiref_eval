In that case, I have a map that you can use for free.
What if I upgraded your ticket to a VIP experience?
A lot of people like to do that.
Your best bet is to head downtown.
I understand that tours aren't for everyone.
Enjoy the sights and sounds of this great city.
That's what I like to do too.
That sounds like fun.
