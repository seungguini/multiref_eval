Ok, here are some brochures to look at.
In that case, I have a map that you can use for free.
If you visit the chamber of commerce site, it gives tourist information.
What if I upgraded your ticket to a VIP experience?
I can give you some recommendations for places to see.
Your best bet is to head downtown.
Enjoy the sights and sounds of this great city.
That's what I like to do too.
