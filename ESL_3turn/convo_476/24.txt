Ok, here are some brochures to look at.
The tour only lasts an hour.  You will have time to explore it on your own afterwards.
In that case, I have a map that you can use for free.
Your best bet is to head downtown.
I understand that tours aren't for everyone.
That's a good idea.
That's what I like to do too.
That sounds like fun.
