The tour only lasts an hour.  You will have time to explore it on your own afterwards.
I can give you some suggestions.
If you visit the chamber of commerce site, it gives tourist information.
Your best bet is to head downtown.
That's a good idea.
Enjoy the sights and sounds of this great city.
Be sure to check out the museum down the street.
That sounds like fun.
