Ok, here are some brochures to look at.
I can give you some suggestions.
What if I upgraded your ticket to a VIP experience?
A lot of people like to do that.
I understand that tours aren't for everyone.
Enjoy the sights and sounds of this great city.
Be sure to check out the museum down the street.
That sounds like fun.
