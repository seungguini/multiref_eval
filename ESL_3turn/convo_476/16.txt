The tour only lasts an hour.  You will have time to explore it on your own afterwards.
In that case, I have a map that you can use for free.
A lot of people like to do that.
I can give you some recommendations for places to see.
I understand that tours aren't for everyone.
Enjoy the sights and sounds of this great city.
That's what I like to do too.
That sounds like fun.
