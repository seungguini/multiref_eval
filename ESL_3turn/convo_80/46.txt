There's another one coming up that you can take that can take you to Gage Avenue.
What were you trying to find?
Oh that sucks.
You should ask the driver before you get off next time.
I'm sure I can help you.
It's only a couple blocks down.
Good luck finding the street!
Which bus did you get off of?
