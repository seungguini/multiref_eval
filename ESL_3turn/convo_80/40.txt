There's another one coming up that you can take that can take you to Gage Avenue.
What were you trying to find?
You should ask the driver before you get off next time.
I'm sure I can help you.
Oh no, well it's not too far.
It's only a couple blocks down.
Good luck finding the street!
Which bus did you get off of?
