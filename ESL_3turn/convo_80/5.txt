There's another one coming up that you can take that can take you to Gage Avenue.
Can I point you in the right direction?
Oh that sucks.
You should ask the driver before you get off next time.
I'm sure I can help you.
It's only a couple blocks down.
Where are you trying to go?
Which bus did you get off of?
