There's another one coming up that you can take that can take you to Gage Avenue.
What were you trying to find?
Can I point you in the right direction?
Oh no, well it's not too far.
It's only a couple blocks down.
Good luck finding the street!
Where are you trying to go?
Which bus did you get off of?
