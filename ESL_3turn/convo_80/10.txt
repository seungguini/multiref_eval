There's another one coming up that you can take that can take you to Gage Avenue.
Yes, the next stop is Gage Avenue.
You should ask the driver before you get off next time.
I'm sure I can help you.
Oh no, well it's not too far.
Good luck finding the street!
Where are you trying to go?
Which bus did you get off of?
