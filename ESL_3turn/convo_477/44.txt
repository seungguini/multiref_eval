Instead of a present, give him tickets to something you can do together.
You should look up some father's day gifts online.
You should look on Pinterest for gift ideas.
Why dont you take him out to dinner?
Does he play golf?
Is there anything that your father has been wanting?
Does he like electronics?
How about a gift certificate?
