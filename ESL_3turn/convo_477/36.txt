Instead of a present, give him tickets to something you can do together.
How about tickets to the game?
What are his interests?
You should look on Pinterest for gift ideas.
Does he play golf?
I am sure your dad will appreciate anything you get him.
Does he like electronics?
How about a gift certificate?
