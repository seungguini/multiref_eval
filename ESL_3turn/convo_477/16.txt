Instead of a present, give him tickets to something you can do together.
You should look up some father's day gifts online.
How about tickets to the game?
Why dont you take him out to dinner?
Has your dad asked for anything?
Does he play golf?
I am sure your dad will appreciate anything you get him.
Does he like electronics?
