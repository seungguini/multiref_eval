How about a book?
You should look up some father's day gifts online.
You should look on Pinterest for gift ideas.
Why dont you take him out to dinner?
Does he play golf?
Is there anything that your father has been wanting?
I am sure your dad will appreciate anything you get him.
Does he like electronics?
