Instead of a present, give him tickets to something you can do together.
You should look up some father's day gifts online.
What are his interests?
What does he like to do?
You should look on Pinterest for gift ideas.
Has your dad asked for anything?
Is there anything that your father has been wanting?
I am sure your dad will appreciate anything you get him.
