Were you sick last week too?
When I was sick you didn't let me borrow yours.
Oh sorry! I didn't know that!
Were you actually sick, or is that just an excuse?
You weren't sick. You were hung over.
No you weren't. I saw you in the student union.
I saw your pictures on Facebook from last night!
Oh, sorry. Sure.
