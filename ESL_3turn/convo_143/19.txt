What were you sick with?
Oh sorry! I didn't know that!
Were you actually sick, or is that just an excuse?
You weren't sick. You were hung over.
I'll let you borrow my notes, but just this once.
No you weren't. I saw you in the student union.
I saw your pictures on Facebook from last night!
Oh, sorry. Sure.
