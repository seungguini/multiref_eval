Too bad I didn't bring them.
Were you sick last week too?
What were you sick with?
Yeah, right!
When I was sick you didn't let me borrow yours.
Oh sorry! I didn't know that!
Were you actually sick, or is that just an excuse?
You weren't sick. You were hung over.
Sure you were.
I'll let you borrow my notes, but just this once.
No you weren't. I saw you in the student union.
I saw your pictures on Facebook from last night!
Oh, sorry. Sure.
Feeling better?
