I don't like going to parties.
it was really good. just tired.
I'm just worried about my test tomorrow.
How could I be after what happened?
I'm just tired.
Oh, no! I'm having a great time!
I would be if my friends had actually showed up.
I just don't like big crowds when everyone is drinking like crazy.
