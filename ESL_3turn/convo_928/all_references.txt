I don't like going to parties.

I'm just worried about my test tomorrow.
How could I be after what happened?
I'm just tired.
I ate too much. My stomach hurts.
I'm just tired. I've worked every day this week.
Yea well, I just found out I have cancer.
Oh, no! I'm having a great time!
I am I just hurt my throat recently so I'm trying to keep it down.
I'm just not happy that my ex is here. He wasn't supposed to be in town this weekend.
I would be if my friends had actually showed up.
I just don't like big crowds when everyone is drinking like crazy.
