I don't like going to parties.
it was really good. just tired.
I'm just tired.
I ate too much. My stomach hurts.
I'm just tired. I've worked every day this week.
Yea well, I just found out I have cancer.
Oh, no! I'm having a great time!
I just don't like big crowds when everyone is drinking like crazy.
