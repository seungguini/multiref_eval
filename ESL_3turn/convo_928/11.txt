I'm not.
I don't like going to parties.
it was really good. just tired.
How could I be after what happened?
I ate too much. My stomach hurts.
I'm just tired. I've worked every day this week.
Oh, no! I'm having a great time!
I'm just not happy that my ex is here. He wasn't supposed to be in town this weekend.
