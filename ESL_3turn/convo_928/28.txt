I'm not.
I don't like going to parties.
I'm just worried about my test tomorrow.
How could I be after what happened?
I'm just tired. I've worked every day this week.
Oh, no! I'm having a great time!
I am I just hurt my throat recently so I'm trying to keep it down.
I'm just not happy that my ex is here. He wasn't supposed to be in town this weekend.
