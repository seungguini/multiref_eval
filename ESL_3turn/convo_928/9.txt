I'm not.
I don't like going to parties.
it was really good. just tired.
I'm just worried about my test tomorrow.
How could I be after what happened?
Yea well, I just found out I have cancer.
I am I just hurt my throat recently so I'm trying to keep it down.
I just don't like big crowds when everyone is drinking like crazy.
