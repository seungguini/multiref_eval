I'm not.
I don't like going to parties.
it was really good. just tired.
I'm just worried about my test tomorrow.
I ate too much. My stomach hurts.
I'm just tired. I've worked every day this week.
I'm just not happy that my ex is here. He wasn't supposed to be in town this weekend.
I just don't like big crowds when everyone is drinking like crazy.
