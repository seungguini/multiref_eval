I'm not.
I don't like going to parties.
it was really good. just tired.
How could I be after what happened?
I ate too much. My stomach hurts.
Yea well, I just found out I have cancer.
I'm just not happy that my ex is here. He wasn't supposed to be in town this weekend.
I just don't like big crowds when everyone is drinking like crazy.
