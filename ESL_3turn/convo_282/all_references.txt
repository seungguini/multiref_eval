It dosen't look very stable.
The paint is chipped and one of the tires is flat.
It looks rather old and raged out.
I'm not interested.
It seems to need a lot of work.
I'll give you $1 for it.
I do not need it right now.
I'm not looking to buy a bike.
I assure you, its not worth any money.
Let me think about it.
Who would buy that?
Probably not.
How much?
I'm not sure right now.
