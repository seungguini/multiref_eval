Do you know why I pulled you over?
Do you know why I pulled you over?
Do you know why I'm stopping you?
I stopped you because you were going twenty miles over the speed limit.
One moment while I run this.
Are you aware that you ran the stop sign?
Are you in a hurry to get somewhere?
Have you had any drinks tonight?
