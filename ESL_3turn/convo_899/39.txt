Do you know why I pulled you over?
Do you know why I pulled you over today?
Do you know why I pulled you over?
Do you know why I'm stopping you?
I stopped you because you were going twenty miles over the speed limit.
One moment while I run this.
Are you away that your left break light is out?
Have you had any drinks tonight?
