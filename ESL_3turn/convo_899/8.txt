Do you know why I pulled you over?
Do you know why I pulled you over today?
Do you know why I pulled you over?
Do you know why I'm stopping you?
I stopped you because you were going twenty miles over the speed limit.
Are you aware that you ran the stop sign?
Are you away that your left break light is out?
Have you had any drinks tonight?
