They only have one type of bus pass.
Since you're a student, you can get that pass. It's the cheapest.
I don't know actually.
You have to ask the bus driver.
You'll need to look at the brochure. There's several different types.
I think they have day passes and multiple day passes.
I would recommend you getting the student pass. It's the best value.
Why, are you looking for discounts?
