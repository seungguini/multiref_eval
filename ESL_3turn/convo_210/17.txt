All sorts of different ones.
They only have one type of bus pass.
All you need is your student id to qualify for the student pass.
You have to ask the bus driver.
They have different kinds.  Discounted rates for seniors and students.
I think they have day passes and multiple day passes.
The bus driver can tell you all about it.
I would recommend you getting the student pass. It's the best value.
