They only have one type of bus pass.
They have student passes for a discount rate.
I don't know actually.
All you need is your student id to qualify for the student pass.
There's only one kind of pass.
You have to ask the bus driver.
I would recommend you getting the student pass. It's the best value.
Why, are you looking for discounts?
