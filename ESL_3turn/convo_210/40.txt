They have student passes for a discount rate.
Since you're a student, you can get that pass. It's the cheapest.
There's only one kind of pass.
You have to ask the bus driver.
You'll need to look at the brochure. There's several different types.
I think they have day passes and multiple day passes.
I would recommend you getting the student pass. It's the best value.
Why, are you looking for discounts?
