Let's go and get something.
There's plenty to eat. Do you want me to make you something?
Look on the middle shelf.
I think you can find something.
I can make you something to eat in a little bit.
I just went to the store yesterday; there is plenty to chose from.
If you can wait a half hour, I'll take you somewhere.
You'd  better have a salad.
