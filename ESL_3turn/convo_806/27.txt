There's plenty to eat. Do you want me to make you something?
Look on the middle shelf.
I think you can find something.
Have the rest of that meatloaf.
I can make you something to eat in a little bit.
I just went to the store yesterday; there is plenty to chose from.
Do you want to come with me to the grocery store?
Why don't we make burgers?
