Yes, there is.
I can make you something to eat in a little bit.
Keep looking.
I just went to the store yesterday; there is plenty to chose from.
Should we order a pizza?
Do you want to come with me to the grocery store?
If you can wait a half hour, I'll take you somewhere.
What did you want to eat?
