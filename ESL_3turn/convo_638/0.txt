I don't want to see you naked!
What caused that?
I told you to put on some sunscreen.
Please don't take your shirt off. I will be embarrassed.
I went to the gym and overexerted myself.
Do you need me to get some aloe for your back?
How will taking off your shirt help your pain?
What happened to your shoulders yesterday?
