How did you hurt your shoulders?
Please don't take your shirt off. I will be embarrassed.
What were doing when you got hurt?
I went to the gym and overexerted myself.
Do you need me to get some aloe for your back?
How will taking off your shirt help your pain?
Did you get burned really bad in the sun?
Is there anything I can do to help?
