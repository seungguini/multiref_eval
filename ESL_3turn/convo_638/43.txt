I don't want to see you naked!
How did you hurt your shoulders?
I told you to put on some sunscreen.
Please don't take your shirt off. I will be embarrassed.
I went to the gym and overexerted myself.
Do you need me to get some aloe for your back?
What happened to your shoulders yesterday?
Did you get burned really bad in the sun?
