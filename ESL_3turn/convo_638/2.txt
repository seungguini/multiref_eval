I don't want to see you naked!
What caused that?
I told you to put on some sunscreen.
Please don't take your shirt off. I will be embarrassed.
What were doing when you got hurt?
How will taking off your shirt help your pain?
What happened to your shoulders yesterday?
Did you get burned really bad in the sun?
