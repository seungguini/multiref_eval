How did you hurt your shoulders?
What caused that?
I told you to put on some sunscreen.
Please don't take your shirt off. I will be embarrassed.
What were doing when you got hurt?
I went to the gym and overexerted myself.
Did you get burned really bad in the sun?
Is there anything I can do to help?
