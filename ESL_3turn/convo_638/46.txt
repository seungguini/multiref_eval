I don't want to see you naked!
How did you hurt your shoulders?
I told you to put on some sunscreen.
Please don't take your shirt off. I will be embarrassed.
I went to the gym and overexerted myself.
Do you need me to get some aloe for your back?
How will taking off your shirt help your pain?
Is there anything I can do to help?
