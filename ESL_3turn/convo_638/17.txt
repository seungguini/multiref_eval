I don't want to see you naked!
How did you hurt your shoulders?
Please don't take your shirt off. I will be embarrassed.
What were doing when you got hurt?
I went to the gym and overexerted myself.
How will taking off your shirt help your pain?
Did you get burned really bad in the sun?
Is there anything I can do to help?
