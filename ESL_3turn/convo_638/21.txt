How did you hurt your shoulders?
What caused that?
Please don't take your shirt off. I will be embarrassed.
What were doing when you got hurt?
I went to the gym and overexerted myself.
Do you need me to get some aloe for your back?
Did you get burned really bad in the sun?
Is there anything I can do to help?
