What caused that?
I told you to put on some sunscreen.
Please don't take your shirt off. I will be embarrassed.
Do you need me to get some aloe for your back?
How will taking off your shirt help your pain?
What happened to your shoulders yesterday?
Did you get burned really bad in the sun?
Is there anything I can do to help?
