What caused that?
Please don't take your shirt off. I will be embarrassed.
I went to the gym and overexerted myself.
You should see a chiropractor.
How will taking off your shirt help your pain?
What happened to your shoulders yesterday?
Did you get burned really bad in the sun?
Is there anything I can do to help?
