I don't want to see you naked!
Please don't take your shirt off. I will be embarrassed.
What were doing when you got hurt?
You should see a chiropractor.
How will taking off your shirt help your pain?
What happened to your shoulders yesterday?
Did you get burned really bad in the sun?
Is there anything I can do to help?
