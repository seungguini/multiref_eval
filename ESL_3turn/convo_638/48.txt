I don't want to see you naked!
How did you hurt your shoulders?
I told you to put on some sunscreen.
Please don't take your shirt off. I will be embarrassed.
What were doing when you got hurt?
Do you need me to get some aloe for your back?
Did you get burned really bad in the sun?
Is there anything I can do to help?
