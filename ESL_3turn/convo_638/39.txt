I don't want to see you naked!
How did you hurt your shoulders?
I told you to put on some sunscreen.
I went to the gym and overexerted myself.
How will taking off your shirt help your pain?
What happened to your shoulders yesterday?
Did you get burned really bad in the sun?
Is there anything I can do to help?
