I don't want to see you naked!
How did you hurt your shoulders?
I told you to put on some sunscreen.
Please don't take your shirt off. I will be embarrassed.
Do you need me to get some aloe for your back?
You should see a chiropractor.
What happened to your shoulders yesterday?
Is there anything I can do to help?
