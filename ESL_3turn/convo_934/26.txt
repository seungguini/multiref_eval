Then why would you start a conversation like that?
You didn't have to. I can hear it in the tone of your voice.
Sorry, it's what people say before they  break up with someone.
I know you are about to break up with me.
What could we possibly need to talk about?
I know but things between us have been off for months.
I am guessing that what you want to do.
Go ahead and break up with me.
