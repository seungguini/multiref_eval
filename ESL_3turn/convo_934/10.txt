Sorry, it's what people say before they  break up with someone.
I know you are about to break up with me.
What could we possibly need to talk about?
What else would we need to talk about?
I am guessing that what you want to do.
Sorry, what do you want to talk about?
Go ahead and break up with me.
Maybe I want to break up with you.
