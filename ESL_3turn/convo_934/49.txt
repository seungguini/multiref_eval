Then why would you start a conversation like that?
You didn't have to. I can hear it in the tone of your voice.
I know you are about to break up with me.
What else would we need to talk about?
I know but things between us have been off for months.
I am guessing that what you want to do.
Maybe I want to break up with you.
Go ahead.  Talk.
