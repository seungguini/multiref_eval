Then why would you start a conversation like that?
You didn't have to. I can hear it in the tone of your voice.
I know you are about to break up with me.
What could we possibly need to talk about?
What else would we need to talk about?
Go ahead and break up with me.
Maybe I want to break up with you.
Go ahead.  Talk.
