Then why would you start a conversation like that?
Sorry, it's what people say before they  break up with someone.
What could we possibly need to talk about?
What else would we need to talk about?
I know but things between us have been off for months.
Go ahead and break up with me.
Maybe I want to break up with you.
Go ahead.  Talk.
