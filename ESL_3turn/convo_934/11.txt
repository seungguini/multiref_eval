Then why would you start a conversation like that?
Sorry, it's what people say before they  break up with someone.
I know you are about to break up with me.
What else would we need to talk about?
Sorry, what do you want to talk about?
Go ahead and break up with me.
Maybe I want to break up with you.
Go ahead.  Talk.
