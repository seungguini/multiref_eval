Then why would you start a conversation like that?
You didn't have to. I can hear it in the tone of your voice.
I know you are about to break up with me.
What could we possibly need to talk about?
What else would we need to talk about?
I am guessing that what you want to do.
Sorry, what do you want to talk about?
Go ahead.  Talk.
