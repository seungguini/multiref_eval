Then why would you start a conversation like that?
You didn't have to. I can hear it in the tone of your voice.
Sorry, it's what people say before they  break up with someone.
I know you are about to break up with me.
Sorry, what do you want to talk about?
Go ahead and break up with me.
Maybe I want to break up with you.
Go ahead.  Talk.
