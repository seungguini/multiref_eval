Then why would you start a conversation like that?
You didn't have to. I can hear it in the tone of your voice.
Sorry, it's what people say before they  break up with someone.
What could we possibly need to talk about?
What else would we need to talk about?
I know but things between us have been off for months.
Sorry, what do you want to talk about?
Go ahead.  Talk.
