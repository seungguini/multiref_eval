That sounds fun, what day is it?
Yeah, I wanted to check that out.
When is it?
Cool!  Can I come with you?
Can I let you know tomorrow if I can go?
Want company?
Are you asking me to go with you?
That sounds interesting.  Mind if I come?
Oh yeah?  Tell me more about it.
I heard about that but forgot!  I will go with you.
Sounds boring.  I don't like to read.
