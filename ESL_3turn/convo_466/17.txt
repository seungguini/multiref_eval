That would be great.
I would love that, thanks.
Sure.  When would you like to meet to talk about the project?
Thank you for asking, but I want to see if my friend needs a partner first.
I'd be honored for you to be my partner.
If you want to I guess that would be OK.
Sure, but I have to warn you, I'm not very good with geometry.
Sure why not?
