That would be great.
Not really.
Sure, do you have any ideas on how to get started.
Sure.  When would you like to meet to talk about the project?
I was actually hoping to partner with Bob.
Will you contribute to the project?
Sure, but I have to warn you, I'm not very good with geometry.
Sure why not?
