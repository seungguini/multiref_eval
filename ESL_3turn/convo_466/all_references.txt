That would be great.
I would love that, thanks.
Yes! That would be great!
Not really.
Sure, do you have any ideas on how to get started.
Sure.  When would you like to meet to talk about the project?
Thank you for asking, but I want to see if my friend needs a partner first.
I was too shy to ask you.
I was actually hoping to partner with Bob.
Will you contribute to the project?
I would love that.
I'd be honored for you to be my partner.
If you want to I guess that would be OK.
Sure, but I have to warn you, I'm not very good with geometry.
Sure why not?
