That would be great.
Yes! That would be great!
Sure.  When would you like to meet to talk about the project?
Thank you for asking, but I want to see if my friend needs a partner first.
I was too shy to ask you.
Will you contribute to the project?
If you want to I guess that would be OK.
Sure, but I have to warn you, I'm not very good with geometry.
