I would love that, thanks.
Not really.
Sure, do you have any ideas on how to get started.
Sure.  When would you like to meet to talk about the project?
Thank you for asking, but I want to see if my friend needs a partner first.
I was too shy to ask you.
Will you contribute to the project?
If you want to I guess that would be OK.
