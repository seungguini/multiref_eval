Thunder roars in indigation.
Thunder makes a loud noise.
It's the rumble you hear.
The sound after the light.
Thunder replies angrily.
Thunder can make your windows rattle.
It's the crackle you hear after the lightening.
The boom you hear in a storm.
Thunder follows lightening's trail.
The part of the storm that makes things shake.
The part that scares animals.
The part that makes your ear drums hurt.
