I'm only going 65.
I'm only going 50.
No one drives at the speed limit.
I'm only going 70.
That means you can go 80.
I'm only going 55.
It's okay if I am going with the flow of traffic.
Right, and I'm going 65.
I think you're wrong it's actually 75.
Everyone else is driving as fast as me.
You sound just like my mother.
Don't worry about it.
Are you scared?  I am a safe driver.
Would you like to drive instead?
You're such a goody 2 shoes.
As long as I don't get caught.
If I don't drive fast, we won't get there on time.
