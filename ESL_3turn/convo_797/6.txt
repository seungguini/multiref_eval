I recommend you see a chiropractor instead!
Can you show me where exactly so I can tell the masseuse where to start.
Why do you sit so much?
I don't know anywhere, sorry.
That sounds more like a problem for a doctor!
Do you sit at a desk for work?
i'm sorry to hear that!
I heard there's one opening next week down the street.
