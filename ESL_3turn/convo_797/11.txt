I recommend you see a chiropractor instead!
Yes, I know a few places.
Can you show me where exactly so I can tell the masseuse where to start.
I actually know a great massage therapist I can refer you to
Yeah, my friend actually owns a massage parlor.
I think that you might need to work on your posture
That sounds more like a problem for a doctor!
I heard there's one opening next week down the street.
