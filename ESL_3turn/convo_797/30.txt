I recommend you see a chiropractor instead!
Yes, I know a few places.
Can you show me where exactly so I can tell the masseuse where to start.
Yeah, my friend actually owns a massage parlor.
I think that you might need to work on your posture
I don't know anywhere, sorry.
No but we can Google it.
I heard there's one opening next week down the street.
