I recommend you see a chiropractor instead!
Yes, I know a few places.
Can you show me where exactly so I can tell the masseuse where to start.
I actually know a great massage therapist I can refer you to
Yeah, my friend actually owns a massage parlor.
Why do you sit so much?
Come with me and we will get that fixed for you in no time.
No but we can Google it.
