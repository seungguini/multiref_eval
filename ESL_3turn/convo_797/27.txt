I recommend you see a chiropractor instead!
Can you show me where exactly so I can tell the masseuse where to start.
Why do you sit so much?
I think that you might need to work on your posture
I don't know anywhere, sorry.
That sounds more like a problem for a doctor!
No but we can Google it.
i'm sorry to hear that!
