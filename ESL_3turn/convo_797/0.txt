I recommend you see a chiropractor instead!
Let me give you the number for my favorite massage therapist.
Why do you sit so much?
Come with me and we will get that fixed for you in no time.
I think that you might need to work on your posture
That sounds more like a problem for a doctor!
Do you sit at a desk for work?
i'm sorry to hear that!
