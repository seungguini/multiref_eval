I recommend you see a chiropractor instead!
Yes, I know a few places.
Let me give you the number for my favorite massage therapist.
Can you show me where exactly so I can tell the masseuse where to start.
I actually know a great massage therapist I can refer you to
Yeah, my friend actually owns a massage parlor.
Why do you sit so much?
Come with me and we will get that fixed for you in no time.
I think that you might need to work on your posture
I don't know anywhere, sorry.
That sounds more like a problem for a doctor!
Do you sit at a desk for work?
No but we can Google it.
i'm sorry to hear that!
I heard there's one opening next week down the street.
