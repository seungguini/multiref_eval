I recommend you see a chiropractor instead!
Yes, I know a few places.
Can you show me where exactly so I can tell the masseuse where to start.
Come with me and we will get that fixed for you in no time.
I don't know anywhere, sorry.
Do you sit at a desk for work?
No but we can Google it.
I heard there's one opening next week down the street.
