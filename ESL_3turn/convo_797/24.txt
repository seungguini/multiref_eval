I recommend you see a chiropractor instead!
Let me give you the number for my favorite massage therapist.
Can you show me where exactly so I can tell the masseuse where to start.
Yeah, my friend actually owns a massage parlor.
I think that you might need to work on your posture
I don't know anywhere, sorry.
Do you sit at a desk for work?
i'm sorry to hear that!
