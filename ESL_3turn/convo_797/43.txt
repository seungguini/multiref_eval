I recommend you see a chiropractor instead!
Can you show me where exactly so I can tell the masseuse where to start.
I actually know a great massage therapist I can refer you to

Why do you sit so much?
I think that you might need to work on your posture
I don't know anywhere, sorry.
That sounds more like a problem for a doctor!
