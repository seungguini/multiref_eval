Let me give you the number for my favorite massage therapist.
Yeah, my friend actually owns a massage parlor.
Why do you sit so much?
I don't know anywhere, sorry.
That sounds more like a problem for a doctor!
Do you sit at a desk for work?
No but we can Google it.
I heard there's one opening next week down the street.
