I recommend you see a chiropractor instead!
Can you show me where exactly so I can tell the masseuse where to start.
Yeah, my friend actually owns a massage parlor.
I think that you might need to work on your posture
That sounds more like a problem for a doctor!
Do you sit at a desk for work?
No but we can Google it.
i'm sorry to hear that!
