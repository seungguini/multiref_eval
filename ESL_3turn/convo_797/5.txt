Can you show me where exactly so I can tell the masseuse where to start.
I actually know a great massage therapist I can refer you to
Yeah, my friend actually owns a massage parlor.
That sounds more like a problem for a doctor!
Do you sit at a desk for work?
No but we can Google it.
i'm sorry to hear that!
I heard there's one opening next week down the street.
