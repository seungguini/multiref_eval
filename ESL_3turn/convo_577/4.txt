I broke my leg last night.
Please don't tell anyone, but I had gotten in a fight but lied about what happened.
Are you sure you won't tell?
Nothing happened, I'm trying to get out of gym class.
It happened in the bedroom.
I sprained my ankle playing basketball yesterday.
I feel down the stairs.
It's pretty embarassing.
