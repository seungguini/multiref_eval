Please don't tell anyone, but I had gotten in a fight but lied about what happened.
Are you sure you won't tell?
I hurt it running from a robbery.
I sprained my ankle playing basketball yesterday.
I feel down the stairs.
I dropped a vase on my foot and now I can't walk.
I was drunk and fell down.
It's pretty embarassing.
