Please don't tell anyone, but I had gotten in a fight but lied about what happened.
I broke my leg spying on Lisa.
I had bought a motorbike behind my dad's back, and fell off of it.
I hurt it running from a robbery.
It happened in the bedroom.
I sprained my ankle playing basketball yesterday.
I dropped a vase on my foot and now I can't walk.
I was drunk and fell down.
