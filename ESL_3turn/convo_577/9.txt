I broke my leg last night.
Nothing happened, I'm trying to get out of gym class.
I had bought a motorbike behind my dad's back, and fell off of it.
It happened in the bedroom.
I sprained my ankle playing basketball yesterday.
I dropped a vase on my foot and now I can't walk.
I was drunk and fell down.
It's pretty embarassing.
