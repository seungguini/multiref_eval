Please don't tell anyone, but I had gotten in a fight but lied about what happened.
Are you sure you won't tell?
Nothing happened, I'm trying to get out of gym class.
I had bought a motorbike behind my dad's back, and fell off of it.
I hurt it running from a robbery.
I feel down the stairs.
I was drunk and fell down.
It's pretty embarassing.
