I broke my leg last night.
Please don't tell anyone, but I had gotten in a fight but lied about what happened.
I broke my leg spying on Lisa.
Nothing happened, I'm trying to get out of gym class.
I sprained my ankle playing basketball yesterday.
I feel down the stairs.
I dropped a vase on my foot and now I can't walk.
I was drunk and fell down.
