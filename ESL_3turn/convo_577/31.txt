I broke my leg last night.
Are you sure you won't tell?
I had bought a motorbike behind my dad's back, and fell off of it.
I hurt it running from a robbery.
I sprained my ankle playing basketball yesterday.
I feel down the stairs.
I dropped a vase on my foot and now I can't walk.
It's pretty embarassing.
