Sounds good.
That sounds like a good plan!
Do I have time to run home and grab my sneakers?
That's a little far. Maybe we can just go around the block instead.
Oh yes I love that park.
Have you tried the new path they made around the lake?
We could go to the new walking trail instead.
I saw a mean-looking stray dog in that park about 30 minutes ago.
