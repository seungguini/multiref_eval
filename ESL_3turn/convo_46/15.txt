Sounds good.
I love the park!
That sounds nice. Let's go.
That sounds like a good plan!
Do I have time to run home and grab my sneakers?
Have you tried the new path they made around the lake?
We could go to the new walking trail instead.
I saw a mean-looking stray dog in that park about 30 minutes ago.
