Sounds good.
I love the park!
That sounds nice. Let's go.
Do I have time to run home and grab my sneakers?
That's a little far. Maybe we can just go around the block instead.
I would love to go with you.
Have you tried the new path they made around the lake?
I saw a mean-looking stray dog in that park about 30 minutes ago.
