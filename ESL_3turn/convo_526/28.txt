OK, I'll keep that in mind,
Ok, how much shorter would you like it?
I wish you told me then. I would have been happy to fix it.
I'll cut it shorter this time.
No problem, I'll go a bit shorter.
I thought you liked it on the long side? That's changed?
You look great no matter what! Now that I know I'll make sure you're happy with your cut before you leave.
Of course. How short would you like it?
