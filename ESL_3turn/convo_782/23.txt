School is hard and life is hard.
Wait 'til you get out and have to survive on your own.
I think that they both are.
We didn't know how great we had it.
Life is amazing though.  It's full of excitement and challenges.
Yeah, school was pretty bad too.
It was at the time.
I mean, I like working better than school to be honest.
