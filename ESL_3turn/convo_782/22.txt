You're wrong.
School is hard and life is hard.
It will get better once you're settled down.
You've been spoiled all these years by your parents.
Life is amazing though.  It's full of excitement and challenges.
if it was easy would you be happier
It was at the time.
I mean, I like working better than school to be honest.
