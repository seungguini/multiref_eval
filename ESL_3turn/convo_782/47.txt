School is hard and life is hard.
Yeah right!
Wait 'til you get out and have to survive on your own.
You've been spoiled all these years by your parents.
Life is amazing though.  It's full of excitement and challenges.
That is back when things were simple.
It was at the time.
I mean, I like working better than school to be honest.
