You're wrong.
Wait 'til you get out and have to survive on your own.
It will get better once you're settled down.
think positive it will get better
Life is amazing though.  It's full of excitement and challenges.
Life is what you make of it.
It was at the time.
I mean, I like working better than school to be honest.
