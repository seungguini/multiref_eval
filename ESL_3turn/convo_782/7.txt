Wait 'til you get out and have to survive on your own.
It will get better once you're settled down.
You've been spoiled all these years by your parents.
We didn't know how great we had it.
Work is a lot worse huh?
think positive it will get better
That is back when things were simple.
I mean, I like working better than school to be honest.
