Life is what you make of it
at times
Wait 'til you get out and have to survive on your own.
It will get better once you're settled down.
Work is a lot worse huh?
Life is amazing though.  It's full of excitement and challenges.
if it was easy would you be happier
I mean, I like working better than school to be honest.
