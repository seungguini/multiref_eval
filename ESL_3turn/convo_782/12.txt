Life is what you make of it
It will get better once you're settled down.
You've been spoiled all these years by your parents.
We didn't know how great we had it.
think positive it will get better
Life is amazing though.  It's full of excitement and challenges.
Yeah, school was pretty bad too.
I mean, I like working better than school to be honest.
