Your doctor referred you to come here for more extensive blood testing.
Our nurse will help you today.
I understand.
We no longer collect labs in the doctors office.
This is just as convenient.
We keep all the lab equipment in one room now, its easier for us.
This will save you some money.
That's interesting.
