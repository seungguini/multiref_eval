Your doctor referred you to come here for more extensive blood testing.
Our nurse will help you today.
I understand.
Unfortunately all blood draws are being referred to here now.
We no longer collect labs in the doctors office.
We keep all the lab equipment in one room now, its easier for us.
This frees up doctor time.
This saves space.
