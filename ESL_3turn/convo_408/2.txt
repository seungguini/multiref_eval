Your doctor referred you to come here for more extensive blood testing.
I understand.
Unfortunately all blood draws are being referred to here now.
What's the name of your doctor?
This is just as convenient.
We keep all the lab equipment in one room now, its easier for us.
This frees up doctor time.
This will save you some money.
