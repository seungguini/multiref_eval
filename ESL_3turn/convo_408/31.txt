Your doctor referred you to come here for more extensive blood testing.
I understand.
Unfortunately all blood draws are being referred to here now.
We no longer collect labs in the doctors office.
We keep all the lab equipment in one room now, its easier for us.
It's a lot cheaper here.
This will save you some money.
This saves space.
