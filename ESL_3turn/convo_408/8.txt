Your doctor referred you to come here for more extensive blood testing.
Our nurse will help you today.
We changed our process.
Unfortunately all blood draws are being referred to here now.
We keep all the lab equipment in one room now, its easier for us.
It's a lot cheaper here.
This will save you some money.
That's interesting.
