Your doctor referred you to come here for more extensive blood testing.
We changed our process.
I understand.
What's the name of your doctor?
We no longer collect labs in the doctors office.
We keep all the lab equipment in one room now, its easier for us.
It's a lot cheaper here.
This saves space.
