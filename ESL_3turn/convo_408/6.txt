Your doctor referred you to come here for more extensive blood testing.
Our nurse will help you today.
I understand.
Unfortunately all blood draws are being referred to here now.
What's the name of your doctor?
We keep all the lab equipment in one room now, its easier for us.
It's a lot cheaper here.
This frees up doctor time.
