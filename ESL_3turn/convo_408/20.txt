Your doctor referred you to come here for more extensive blood testing.
Our nurse will help you today.
We changed our process.
Unfortunately all blood draws are being referred to here now.
We no longer collect labs in the doctors office.
This frees up doctor time.
This saves space.
That's interesting.
