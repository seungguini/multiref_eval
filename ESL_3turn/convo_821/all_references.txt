When were you at my house?
Why did you not stop by?
Isn't it nice?
Yes I'm so excited!
Oh, that's right! I guess you saw it when you got here.
Oh, yes what do you think of it?
I am so excited with it!
Do you like it?
Are you spying on me?
It kind of looks like you car.
It drives so good.
It cost me a fortune but I love it!
