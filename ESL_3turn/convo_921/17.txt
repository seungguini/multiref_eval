Okay very good. What did you find?
What did you find out?
Thank you. You are quick.
So how was the inspection?
I was waiting for your call. Thank you.
I'm worried about the electrical system. What did you find out about that?
How was the result? Was there any problem?
And? Do you think it will work?
