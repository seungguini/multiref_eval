Okay very good. What did you find?
What did you find out?
Thank you. You are quick.
Have you found any problems?
How did that turn out?
So how was the inspection?
I was waiting for your call. Thank you.
I'm worried about the electrical system. What did you find out about that?
Is that standard procedure?
How was the result? Was there any problem?
Does it look really bad?
And? Do you think it will work?
When can you give me your findings?
Were there any complications?
