Okay very good. What did you find?
Thank you. You are quick.
Have you found any problems?
I was waiting for your call. Thank you.
I'm worried about the electrical system. What did you find out about that?
How was the result? Was there any problem?
When can you give me your findings?
Were there any complications?
