She puts her feet on the bed while she has her sneakers on.
It's usually my fault.
She's very emotional during certain times of the month.
She leaves her makeup all over the bathroom.
She accuses me of cheating.
She never listens to me when I talk.
She is overly needy.
Just when I'm in certain moods.
