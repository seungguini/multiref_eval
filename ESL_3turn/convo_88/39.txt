She always assumes and doesn't ask me first.
She puts her feet on the bed while she has her sneakers on.
She's very emotional during certain times of the month.
She leaves her makeup all over the bathroom.
Just little things.
She accuses me of cheating.
She never listens to me when I talk.
She is overly needy.
