She always assumes and doesn't ask me first.
She puts her feet on the bed while she has her sneakers on.
It's usually my fault.
She complains constantly.
She's very emotional during certain times of the month.
She leaves her makeup all over the bathroom.
She accuses me of cheating.
Just when I'm in certain moods.
