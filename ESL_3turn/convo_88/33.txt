She always assumes and doesn't ask me first.
She puts her feet on the bed while she has her sneakers on.
It's usually my fault.
She's very emotional during certain times of the month.
She never listens to me when I talk.
She is overly needy.
When she talks back to me.
Just when I'm in certain moods.
