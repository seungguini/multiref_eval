She always assumes and doesn't ask me first.
She puts her feet on the bed while she has her sneakers on.
She complains constantly.
She's very emotional during certain times of the month.
She leaves her makeup all over the bathroom.
I don't even know.
When she talks back to me.
Just when I'm in certain moods.
