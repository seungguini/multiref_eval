She always assumes and doesn't ask me first.
She puts her feet on the bed while she has her sneakers on.
She's very emotional during certain times of the month.
She leaves her makeup all over the bathroom.
She accuses me of cheating.
She never listens to me when I talk.
I don't even know.
When she talks back to me.
