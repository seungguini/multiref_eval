Its okay.
It's good, I miss them.
We have always been very close.
It's usually pretty good.
It's not great, I don't talk to them often.
It's ok, they are pretty busy and don't have much time for me.
I wish it were better.
It's a strong relationship.
They are my best friends
It's a little rocky right now.
It's up and down most of the time.
My parents are my best friends!
