They had different goals in life.
They hated each other.
About 10 years ago.
My dad cheated on her.
They grew apart.
My dad had a girlfriend, my mom wasn't happy when she found out.
Just last year.
They disagreed on what religion with which to raise me.
My mom was too controlling.
3 months ago.
They always were fighting.
My dad left.
When I was a baby.
I'm not sure.
They both cheated on each other.
What difference does it make?
