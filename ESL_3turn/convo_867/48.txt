Crappy insurance the government forces companies to offer.
A healthcare plan that was made possible by the Obama administration.
It's a government-regulated health insurance plan. It's done wonders for low-income people.
Government-subsidized insurance.
Where have you been the past decade?
Do you ever watch the news?
The healthcare marketplace thing.
Insurance that other people pay for me to get.
