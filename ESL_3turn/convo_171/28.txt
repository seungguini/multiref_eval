Honestly, not really. I guess I'd have to lose new ones.
I do have other skills but it's not as honed as the ones I use for my current job.
Well... I could use my skills from this job at a similar position in the industry.
There's not much else I can do outside of what I know right now.
I used to work in retail before this position, so I can go back to that
I only developed skills to help me in this job
I work another job on the weekend.
No, I guess I should start learning new things.
