Only basic skills like reading, writing, basic math
Well... I could use my skills from this job at a similar position in the industry.
There's not much else I can do outside of what I know right now.
I used to work in retail before this position, so I can go back to that
I've been learning a new skill
I work another job on the weekend.
I am a great baker.
Not really.
