I do have other skills but it's not as honed as the ones I use for my current job.
Only basic skills like reading, writing, basic math
There's not much else I can do outside of what I know right now.
I only developed skills to help me in this job
I work another job on the weekend.
I am a great baker.
No, I guess I should start learning new things.
Not really.
