Honestly, not really. I guess I'd have to lose new ones.
I do have other skills but it's not as honed as the ones I use for my current job.
yes.  i have been taking night classes
I used to work in retail before this position, so I can go back to that
I've been learning a new skill
I only developed skills to help me in this job
I work another job on the weekend.
Not really.
