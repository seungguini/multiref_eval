Honestly, not really. I guess I'd have to lose new ones.
Only basic skills like reading, writing, basic math
Well... I could use my skills from this job at a similar position in the industry.
There's not much else I can do outside of what I know right now.
I've been learning a new skill
I only developed skills to help me in this job
I work another job on the weekend.
Not really.
