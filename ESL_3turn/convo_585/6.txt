Yea, I agree but it's what the college charges.
It is what it  is.
You can try parking off street.
It's comparable to what permits for other nearby structures cost.
$300 isn't too bad to be allowed to park.
I know. It's a lot cheaper to use public transportation.
It's a scam.
Yea I know I can't afford it.
