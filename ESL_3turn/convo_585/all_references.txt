Yea, I agree but it's what the college charges.
It is what it is.
It is what it  is.
You will be allowed to park in any available lot.
You can try parking off street.
It's comparable to what permits for other nearby structures cost.
I don't know why.
$300 isn't too bad to be allowed to park.
I know. It's a lot cheaper to use public transportation.
It's a scam.
It used to be $400 so be grateful.
Yea I know I can't afford it.
