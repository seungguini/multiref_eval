Yea, I agree but it's what the college charges.
It is what it is.
You will be allowed to park in any available lot.
You can try parking off street.
It's comparable to what permits for other nearby structures cost.
$300 isn't too bad to be allowed to park.
It's a scam.
It used to be $400 so be grateful.
