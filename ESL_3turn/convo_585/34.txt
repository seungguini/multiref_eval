It is what it  is.
You will be allowed to park in any available lot.
You can try parking off street.
It's comparable to what permits for other nearby structures cost.
$300 isn't too bad to be allowed to park.
I know. It's a lot cheaper to use public transportation.
It used to be $400 so be grateful.
