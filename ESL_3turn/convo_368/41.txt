Yes two blocks too soon.
It happens to the best of them.
I don't think there is another bus.
If you walk a few blocks that way, you should be in the right place.
Just keep walking and you'll get to Gage eventually.
The bus is not even to the next corner yet.
If you're in a rush you might want to get a cab.
Are you new to the city?
