That's only the next one comes soon.
Yes two blocks too soon.
It happens to the best of them.
It's okay, there's another one coming around in a few minutes.
I don't think there is another bus.
If you walk a few blocks that way, you should be in the right place.
Just keep walking and you'll get to Gage eventually.
Are you new to the city?
