It happens to the best of them.
No worries, it happens from time to time. Just wait for the next bus.
No you got off too late you have to go back one.
I don't think there is another bus.
If you walk a few blocks that way, you should be in the right place.
There's another bus coming right now.
Just keep walking and you'll get to Gage eventually.
Are you new to the city?
