Yes two blocks too soon.
No worries, it happens from time to time. Just wait for the next bus.
No you got off too late you have to go back one.
I don't think there is another bus.
Just keep walking and you'll get to Gage eventually.
The bus is not even to the next corner yet.
If you're in a rush you might want to get a cab.
You're in trouble.
