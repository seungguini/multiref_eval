Yes two blocks too soon.
It happens to the best of them.
No worries, it happens from time to time. Just wait for the next bus.
No you got off too late you have to go back one.
If you walk a few blocks that way, you should be in the right place.
There's another bus coming right now.
The bus is not even to the next corner yet.
If you're in a rush you might want to get a cab.
