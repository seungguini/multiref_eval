That's only the next one comes soon.
Yes two blocks too soon.
No worries, it happens from time to time. Just wait for the next bus.
I don't think there is another bus.
If you walk a few blocks that way, you should be in the right place.
There's another bus coming right now.
Just keep walking and you'll get to Gage eventually.
You're in trouble.
