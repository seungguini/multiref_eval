That's only the next one comes soon.
Yes two blocks too soon.
It's okay, there's another one coming around in a few minutes.
No you got off too late you have to go back one.
If you walk a few blocks that way, you should be in the right place.
Just keep walking and you'll get to Gage eventually.
If you're in a rush you might want to get a cab.
You're in trouble.
