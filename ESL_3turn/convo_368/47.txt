It happens to the best of them.
No worries, it happens from time to time. Just wait for the next bus.
No you got off too late you have to go back one.
I don't think there is another bus.
There's another bus coming right now.
The bus is not even to the next corner yet.
You're in trouble.
Are you new to the city?
