That's only the next one comes soon.
It happens to the best of them.
It's okay, there's another one coming around in a few minutes.
No worries, it happens from time to time. Just wait for the next bus.
I don't think there is another bus.
Just keep walking and you'll get to Gage eventually.
If you're in a rush you might want to get a cab.
You're in trouble.
