It happens to the best of them.
No you got off too late you have to go back one.
I don't think there is another bus.
If you walk a few blocks that way, you should be in the right place.
There's another bus coming right now.
If you're in a rush you might want to get a cab.
You're in trouble.
Are you new to the city?
