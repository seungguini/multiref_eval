That's only the next one comes soon.
It happens to the best of them.
It's okay, there's another one coming around in a few minutes.
No you got off too late you have to go back one.
There's another bus coming right now.
Just keep walking and you'll get to Gage eventually.
The bus is not even to the next corner yet.
You're in trouble.
