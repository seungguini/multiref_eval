It's okay, there's another one coming around in a few minutes.
If you walk a few blocks that way, you should be in the right place.
There's another bus coming right now.
Just keep walking and you'll get to Gage eventually.
If you're in a rush you might want to get a cab.
You're in trouble.
Are you new to the city?
