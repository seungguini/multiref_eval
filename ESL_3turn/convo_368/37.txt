Yes two blocks too soon.
It happens to the best of them.
No worries, it happens from time to time. Just wait for the next bus.
No you got off too late you have to go back one.
There's another bus coming right now.
Just keep walking and you'll get to Gage eventually.
The bus is not even to the next corner yet.
Are you new to the city?
