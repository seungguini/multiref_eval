It's okay, there's another one coming around in a few minutes.
No worries, it happens from time to time. Just wait for the next bus.
No you got off too late you have to go back one.
I don't think there is another bus.
The bus is not even to the next corner yet.
If you're in a rush you might want to get a cab.
You're in trouble.
Are you new to the city?
