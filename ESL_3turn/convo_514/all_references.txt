I wonder if it will be nice.
Oh joy, this should be soooooo much fun.
I'm not going with you.
OK is that the last one today?
Which apartment is that?
Darn, I was really hoping we could take a break.
I don't really have a choice but to go, right?
It's exhausting.
I hope we like this apartment.
Can we just cancel it and go get something to eat?
I am excited about that one.
I hope it's nice.
Is that the one that Monica recommended?
