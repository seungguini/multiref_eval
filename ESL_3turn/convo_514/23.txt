I wonder if it will be nice.
OK is that the last one today?
Which apartment is that?
Darn, I was really hoping we could take a break.
I don't really have a choice but to go, right?
I hope we like this apartment.
Can we just cancel it and go get something to eat?
Is that the one that Monica recommended?
