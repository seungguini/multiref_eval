I wish they would get a move on though.
I guess so. . .
It is taking forever
Well it's getting very annoying!
I can't believe it's taking them so long.
It's ridiculous
Why do though?
We are going to miss the whole show if they don't let us in soon!
I guess you're right about that.
Next time we are going to have to get here 3 hours ahead!
There is such a thing is overdoing it.
No one ever mentioned that there would be a long line.
I think they're being absolutely ridiculous.
I can't believe that we still have 30 people in front of us.
