To me, one seat is the same as the next.
Window seats make me feel nauseous!
I don't like looking outside because it makes me nervous.
So that means that I never get to sit by the window when I travel with you?
You always have been that way.
I do too i suppose
Windows are cool.
Glad you got that seat then.
