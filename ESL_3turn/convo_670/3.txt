To me, one seat is the same as the next.
I like sitting on the aisle seat.
I don't like looking outside because it makes me nervous.
So that means that I never get to sit by the window when I travel with you?
You always have been that way.
It doesn't matter much on such a cloudy day!
Yeah I like being able to look outside too.
Windows are cool.
