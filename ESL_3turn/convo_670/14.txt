To me, one seat is the same as the next.
I like sitting on the aisle seat.
Window seats make me feel nauseous!
I don't like looking outside because it makes me nervous.
You always have been that way.
It doesn't matter much on such a cloudy day!
I do too i suppose
Yeah I like being able to look outside too.
