To me, one seat is the same as the next.
I like sitting on the aisle seat.
I think it's scary.
Window seats make me feel nauseous!
So that means that I never get to sit by the window when I travel with you?
You always have been that way.
Yeah I like being able to look outside too.
Glad you got that seat then.
