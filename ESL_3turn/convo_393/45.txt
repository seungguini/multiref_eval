Man, I wish. Donald Trump won instead, now we're screwed.
Are you sure about that?
As long as Trump isn't president I'm fine.
That's a good point.
What does that have to do with anything?
I'm just worried about the people in Congress.
She can't be any worse than the guy that just left office.
Do you vote for someone based on things like that?
