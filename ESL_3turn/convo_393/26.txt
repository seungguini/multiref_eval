Man, I wish. Donald Trump won instead, now we're screwed.
Are you sure about that?
Do you think that will change the course of history?
That's a good point.
What does that have to do with anything?
I'm just worried about the people in Congress.
Do you vote for someone based on things like that?
I think she'll do a great job.
