Man, I wish. Donald Trump won instead, now we're screwed.
Are you sure about that?
As long as Trump isn't president I'm fine.
That's a good point.
I'm just worried about the people in Congress.
Are you voting for a women?
Do you vote for someone based on things like that?
I think she'll do a great job.
