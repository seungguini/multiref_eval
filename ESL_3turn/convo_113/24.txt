Does the gun have to be registered?
I'm against guns. No thank you.
That sounds like a money maker if you have some old guns laying around.
Why are they buying guns?
I think they need stricter gun laws.
Are they buying guns from people who own them illegally?
How do I participate?
Do you know what kind of gun you want? How much ammo?
