Does the gun have to be registered?
Why are they buying guns?
What if it doesn't belong to you?
I think they need stricter gun laws.
Cool. I could trade in my old pistol and use the money to buy an upgrade.
Are they buying guns from people who own them illegally?
How do I participate?
Do you know what kind of gun you want? How much ammo?
