Does the gun have to be registered?
I'm against guns. No thank you.
That sounds like a money maker if you have some old guns laying around.
Why are they buying guns?
What if it doesn't belong to you?
I think they need stricter gun laws.
Cool. I could trade in my old pistol and use the money to buy an upgrade.
How do I participate?
