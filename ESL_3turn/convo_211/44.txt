What seems to be problem?
It's actually very easy.
What do you have so far?
Do you need to live close to where you work?
It can be confusing sometimes.
There's lots of nice apartments just a couple of miles from here.
Did you get your roommates to help?
Maybe we could just drive around all afternoon and look at some places?
