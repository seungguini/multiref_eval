What seems to be problem?
First of all you have to figure out how much you can spend on the apartment.
What do you have so far?
Are you having trouble with motivation or ideas?
It can be confusing sometimes.
I have access to an apartment site.  I can give you my username and password.
There's lots of nice apartments just a couple of miles from here.
I'm sorry you're having a problem.
