What seems to be problem?
It's actually very easy.
What do you have so far?
Are you having trouble with motivation or ideas?
Do you need to live close to where you work?
It can be confusing sometimes.
There's lots of nice apartments just a couple of miles from here.
I'm sorry you're having a problem.
