No problem, let me give you a hand.
Where have you looked so far?
What seems to be problem?
Do you need to live close to where you work?
It can be confusing sometimes.
There's lots of nice apartments just a couple of miles from here.
I'm sorry you're having a problem.
Did you get your roommates to help?
