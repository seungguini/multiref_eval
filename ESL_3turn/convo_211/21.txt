No problem, let me give you a hand.
What seems to be problem?
First of all you have to figure out how much you can spend on the apartment.
It can be confusing sometimes.
I have access to an apartment site.  I can give you my username and password.
I'm sorry you're having a problem.
Did you get your roommates to help?
Maybe we could just drive around all afternoon and look at some places?
