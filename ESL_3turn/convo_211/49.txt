No problem, let me give you a hand.
Where have you looked so far?
First of all you have to figure out how much you can spend on the apartment.
Do you need to live close to where you work?
It can be confusing sometimes.
I'm sorry you're having a problem.
Did you get your roommates to help?
Maybe we could just drive around all afternoon and look at some places?
