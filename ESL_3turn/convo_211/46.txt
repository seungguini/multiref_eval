No problem, let me give you a hand.
What seems to be problem?
First of all you have to figure out how much you can spend on the apartment.
It's actually very easy.
What do you have so far?
Are you having trouble with motivation or ideas?
It can be confusing sometimes.
I'm sorry you're having a problem.
