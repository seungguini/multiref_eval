No problem, let me give you a hand.
Where have you looked so far?
What seems to be problem?
It's actually very easy.
Are you having trouble with motivation or ideas?
Do you need to live close to where you work?
There's lots of nice apartments just a couple of miles from here.
I'm sorry you're having a problem.
