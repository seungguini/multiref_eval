No problem, let me give you a hand.
Where have you looked so far?
It's actually very easy.
Do you need to live close to where you work?
It can be confusing sometimes.
I'm sorry you're having a problem.
Did you get your roommates to help?
Maybe we could just drive around all afternoon and look at some places?
