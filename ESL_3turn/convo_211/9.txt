Where have you looked so far?
What seems to be problem?
It's actually very easy.
What do you have so far?
Are you having trouble with motivation or ideas?
Do you need to live close to where you work?
I have access to an apartment site.  I can give you my username and password.
Maybe we could just drive around all afternoon and look at some places?
