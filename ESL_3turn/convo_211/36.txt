What seems to be problem?
It's actually very easy.
What do you have so far?
Are you having trouble with motivation or ideas?
It can be confusing sometimes.
There's lots of nice apartments just a couple of miles from here.
I'm sorry you're having a problem.
Maybe we could just drive around all afternoon and look at some places?
