Well then why don't you feed it?
Just give me one minute.
Then why don't you do it? I'm busy.
I'm sorry, I forgot.
I am not going to stop right now, the cat won't starve in 15 minutes.
He meows all the time.
Just a second. He won't starve.
He'll survive.
I think we're out of food.
Why can't you feed him?
He just ate an hour ago.
He always meows.
Can you grab a can of food?
Ok I'll feed him now.
