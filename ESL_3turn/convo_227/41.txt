You can get one online.
You can purchase one at that kiosk down there.
Oh no, sorry, I'm not from around here.
There's a kiosk just across the street that sells passes!
I don't know where you can purchase one.
Just go to the kiosk over there!
Your subway pass should work for the bus.
I usually just pay with cash or show my student ID.
