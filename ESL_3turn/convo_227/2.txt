You can get one online.
Oh no, sorry, I'm not from around here.
There's a kiosk just across the street that sells passes!
Just go to the kiosk over there!
You can order one over the phone.
Your subway pass should work for the bus.
I do not know where to get one.
I usually just pay with cash or show my student ID.
