This is my first day on the job so I actually don't know that answer!
There's a kiosk just across the street that sells passes!
I don't know where you can purchase one.
You can order one over the phone.
Your subway pass should work for the bus.
I do not know where to get one.
Talk to the man in the yellow vest.
I usually just pay with cash or show my student ID.
