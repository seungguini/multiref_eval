Well, that's not how you bake a cake.
What kind are you going to make him?
What kind of cake were you thinking about?
I saw a new cake recipe that you should try!
It would probably be easier to get him one from the store!
What's his favorite flavor of cake?
I could never bake and decorate a cake on my own!
Does he like chocolate or vanilla?
