What kind are you going to make him?
I bet he would love a homemade cake.
You've got to. It's tradition!
I saw a new cake recipe that you should try!
What kind of theme would it be?
It would probably be easier to get him one from the store!
What's his favorite flavor of cake?
Does he like chocolate or vanilla?
