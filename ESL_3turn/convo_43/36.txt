I love to bake. I'll help.
Well, that's not how you bake a cake.
You've got to. It's tradition!
What kind of cake were you thinking about?
I saw a new cake recipe that you should try!
What kind of theme would it be?
It would probably be easier to get him one from the store!
I could never bake and decorate a cake on my own!
