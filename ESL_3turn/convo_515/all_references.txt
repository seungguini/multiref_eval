I have a boyfriend already.
I don't really know you all that well.
I'm just not in the mood.
I'm not in the mood.
I think you're a nice guy but I just like you as a friend.
You're not really my type.
Oh yeah, sure, I'll go with you then.
I think you know the answer to that.
I am not attracted to you.
You're about as ugly as a three headed mule.
Do you really have to ask?
You are not my type.
I've already got a girlfriend.
I'm just not interested.
You are ugly.
For the last time Dave, I've got a fiancee!
You were very rude to me.
