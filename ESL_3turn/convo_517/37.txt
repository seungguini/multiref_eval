Yes, would you like anything sent up after the call?
Sure, I'll do it for you.
We will do that.
Yes, I won't be here in the morning but our morning staff will call you at six tomorrow.
No, unfortunately wake-up calls only begin after nine.
I don't think I can wake up that early.
We will call you then.
Yes, have a good evening.
