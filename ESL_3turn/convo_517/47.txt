Yes, I have you all set for a six am wake-up call.
Yes, would you like anything sent up after the call?
Sure, I'll do it for you.
No, unfortunately wake-up calls only begin after nine.
I don't think I can wake up that early.
Sure, but I don't envy you the time.
We will call you then.
Yes, have a good evening.
