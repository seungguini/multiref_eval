Yes, I have you all set for a six am wake-up call.
Sure, I'll do it for you.
Yes, I won't be here in the morning but our morning staff will call you at six tomorrow.
No, unfortunately wake-up calls only begin after nine.
I don't think I can wake up that early.
Yes Sir, no problem.
Sure, but I don't envy you the time.
Yes, have a good evening.
