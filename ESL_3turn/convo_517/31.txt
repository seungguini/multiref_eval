Yes, I have you all set for a six am wake-up call.
Yes, would you like anything sent up after the call?
Sure, I'll do it for you.
Yes, I won't be here in the morning but our morning staff will call you at six tomorrow.
Yes Sir, no problem.
Sure, but I don't envy you the time.
We will call you then.
Yes, have a good evening.
