Yes, would you like anything sent up after the call?
Sure, I'll do it for you.
Yes, I won't be here in the morning but our morning staff will call you at six tomorrow.
I don't think I can wake up that early.
Yes Sir, no problem.
Sure, but I don't envy you the time.
Happy to do so.
We will call you then.
