The hills are brutal.
Yes, but it is very beautiful out here.
I didn't know that it was going to be so hot today.
I love the walking.
I'm not sure if I can make it all the way to the top.
Why did we think it would be a good idea to hike in mid-summer?
How much longer to we have to go.
Maybe we should turn around soon.
