The hills are brutal.
We need to make sure we rest so we don't get heat exhaustion
I love the walking.
It is much hotter than what the weather forecaster said.
Why did we think it would be a good idea to hike in mid-summer?
How much longer to we have to go.
Maybe we should turn around soon.
We can rest in the shade for a while.
