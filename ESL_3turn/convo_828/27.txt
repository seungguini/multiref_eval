The hills are brutal.
We need to make sure we rest so we don't get heat exhaustion
I know. Can't believe how hot it is.
It is much hotter than what the weather forecaster said.
I'm not sure if I can make it all the way to the top.
How much longer to we have to go.
Maybe we should turn around soon.
We can rest in the shade for a while.
