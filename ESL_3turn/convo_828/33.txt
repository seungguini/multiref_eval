The hills are brutal.
We need to make sure we rest so we don't get heat exhaustion
I didn't know that it was going to be so hot today.
I know. Can't believe how hot it is.
I love the walking.
Why did we think it would be a good idea to hike in mid-summer?
How much longer to we have to go.
Maybe we should turn around soon.
