The hills are brutal.
Yes, but it is very beautiful out here.
I didn't know that it was going to be so hot today.
I know. Can't believe how hot it is.
I love the walking.
It is much hotter than what the weather forecaster said.
Why did we think it would be a good idea to hike in mid-summer?
Maybe we should turn around soon.
