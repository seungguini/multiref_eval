Yes, but it is very beautiful out here.
We need to make sure we rest so we don't get heat exhaustion
I know. Can't believe how hot it is.
I love the walking.
It is much hotter than what the weather forecaster said.
Why did we think it would be a good idea to hike in mid-summer?
How much longer to we have to go.
Maybe we should turn around soon.
