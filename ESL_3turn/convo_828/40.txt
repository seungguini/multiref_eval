The hills are brutal.
Yes, but it is very beautiful out here.
We need to make sure we rest so we don't get heat exhaustion
I didn't know that it was going to be so hot today.
I love the walking.
I'm not sure if I can make it all the way to the top.
Maybe we should turn around soon.
We can rest in the shade for a while.
