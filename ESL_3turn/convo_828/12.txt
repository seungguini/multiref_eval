The hills are brutal.
I didn't know that it was going to be so hot today.
I know. Can't believe how hot it is.
I love the walking.
It is much hotter than what the weather forecaster said.
I'm not sure if I can make it all the way to the top.
Maybe we should turn around soon.
We can rest in the shade for a while.
