No way, i don't want to fall!
Why would I step over there if it's falling apart?
This floor board is all rotted out.
Ok, let's go to Lowe's and get some supplies.
Alright, but if I fall through it you're paying my hospital bill.
Call the guy.
You're right, it is falling apart.
The landlord is responsible for these repairs.
