I'm suing you for telling me to step there.
Why would I step over there if it's falling apart?
Wow, somebody's going to get hurt if we don't fix that.
This floor board is all rotted out.
No, I believe you.
Alright, but if I fall through it you're paying my hospital bill.
I stepped there before and didn't notice anything
You're right, it is falling apart.
