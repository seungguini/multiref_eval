No way, i don't want to fall!
Why would I step over there if it's falling apart?
Okay, over where?
Wow, somebody's going to get hurt if we don't fix that.
I stepped there before and didn't notice anything
Call the guy.
You're right, it is falling apart.
The landlord is responsible for these repairs.
