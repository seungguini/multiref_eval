No way, i don't want to fall!
I'm suing you for telling me to step there.
Look, this tile is popping off.
Why would I step over there if it's falling apart?
Wow, somebody's going to get hurt if we don't fix that.
This floor board is all rotted out.
Alright, but if I fall through it you're paying my hospital bill.
Call the guy.
