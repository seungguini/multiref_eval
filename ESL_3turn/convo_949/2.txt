I'm suing you for telling me to step there.
Look, this tile is popping off.
Why would I step over there if it's falling apart?
Okay, over where?
No, I believe you.
Alright, but if I fall through it you're paying my hospital bill.
You're right, it is falling apart.
The landlord is responsible for these repairs.
