No way, i don't want to fall!
Why would I step over there if it's falling apart?
Okay, over where?
This floor board is all rotted out.
You step over there!
Alright, but if I fall through it you're paying my hospital bill.
I stepped there before and didn't notice anything
You're right, it is falling apart.
