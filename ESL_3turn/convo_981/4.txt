I would love to live here.
This house is one of a kind.
The house was made in 1895 and still holds its ground till today!
I'm totally going to put a tire swing on this tree to play on.
What are you trying to say?
Do you think we should buy it?
I'm not sure if we can afford it!
Let me give you the grand tour.
