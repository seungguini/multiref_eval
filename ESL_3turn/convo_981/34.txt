This house is one of a kind.
It really is.
The house was made in 1895 and still holds its ground till today!
I'm totally going to put a tire swing on this tree to play on.
What are you trying to say?
Do you think we should buy it?
I don't know if I'm ready to move.
Where would you guys like to take a look at first?
