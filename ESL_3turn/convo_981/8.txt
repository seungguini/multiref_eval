The backyard is gorgeous!
Let's put an offer on it.
The house was made in 1895 and still holds its ground till today!
What are you trying to say?
This house currently has a reduced price, buy it while you can.
I don't know if I'm ready to move.
Where would you guys like to take a look at first?
I'm not sure if we can afford it!
