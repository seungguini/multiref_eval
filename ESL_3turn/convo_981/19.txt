This house is one of a kind.
The backyard is gorgeous!
The house was made in 1895 and still holds its ground till today!
I'm totally going to put a tire swing on this tree to play on.
Do you think we should buy it?
This house currently has a reduced price, buy it while you can.
I'm not sure if we can afford it!
Let me give you the grand tour.
