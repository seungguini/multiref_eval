I would love to live here.
This house is one of a kind.
The backyard is gorgeous!
Let's put an offer on it.
The house was made in 1895 and still holds its ground till today!
I'm totally going to put a tire swing on this tree to play on.
This house currently has a reduced price, buy it while you can.
I don't know if I'm ready to move.
