I would love to live here.
Let's put an offer on it.
I'm totally going to put a tire swing on this tree to play on.
What are you trying to say?
Do you think we should buy it?
This house currently has a reduced price, buy it while you can.
I don't know if I'm ready to move.
Let me give you the grand tour.
