This house is one of a kind.
The backyard is gorgeous!
It really is.
The house was made in 1895 and still holds its ground till today!
This house currently has a reduced price, buy it while you can.
I don't know if I'm ready to move.
Where would you guys like to take a look at first?
I'm not sure if we can afford it!
