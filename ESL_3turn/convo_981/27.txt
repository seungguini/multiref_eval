This house is one of a kind.
It really is.
The house was made in 1895 and still holds its ground till today!
What are you trying to say?
Do you think we should buy it?
This house currently has a reduced price, buy it while you can.
I don't know if I'm ready to move.
I'm not sure if we can afford it!
