I would love to live here.
This house is one of a kind.
The backyard is gorgeous!
It really is.
Let's put an offer on it.
The house was made in 1895 and still holds its ground till today!
I'm totally going to put a tire swing on this tree to play on.
What are you trying to say?
Do you think we should buy it?
This house currently has a reduced price, buy it while you can.
I don't know if I'm ready to move.
Where would you guys like to take a look at first?
I'm not sure if we can afford it!
Let me give you the grand tour.
