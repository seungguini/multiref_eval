I would love to live here.
This house is one of a kind.
Let's put an offer on it.
The house was made in 1895 and still holds its ground till today!
What are you trying to say?
This house currently has a reduced price, buy it while you can.
I don't know if I'm ready to move.
Where would you guys like to take a look at first?
