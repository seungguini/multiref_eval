I would love to live here.
This house is one of a kind.
I'm totally going to put a tire swing on this tree to play on.
Do you think we should buy it?
This house currently has a reduced price, buy it while you can.
Where would you guys like to take a look at first?
I'm not sure if we can afford it!
Let me give you the grand tour.
