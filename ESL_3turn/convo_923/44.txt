I was so scared. I was not able to sleep afterwards.
I missed it but I hope to catch it later.
No, I don't like anything with zombies or anything scary.

It was crazy. I couldn't believe how it ended!
No, I had to change the channel. It was so depressing.
Yes. Is it a series? This is the first episode I've seen.
