I kind of got bored of it, does it get better?
Yeah. It's my favorite.
I missed it but I hope to catch it later.
No, I don't like anything with zombies or anything scary.
No, but I have it recorded.
Yes, I love it so much, but I can't believe what happened last episode.
No, I had to change the channel. It was so depressing.
Of course, it is amazing.
