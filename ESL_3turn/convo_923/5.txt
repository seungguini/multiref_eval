I kind of got bored of it, does it get better?
I was so scared. I was not able to sleep afterwards.
I missed it but I hope to catch it later.
Yeah! That episode was awesome!
Yes, I love it so much, but I can't believe what happened last episode.
No, I had to change the channel. It was so depressing.
Yes. Is it a series? This is the first episode I've seen.
