No that show sucks.
I kind of got bored of it, does it get better?
I was so scared. I was not able to sleep afterwards.
Yeah. It's my favorite.
I missed it but I hope to catch it later.
Yes, whoever created the show is a genius.
It was crazy. I couldn't believe how it ended!
No, I had to change the channel. It was so depressing.
