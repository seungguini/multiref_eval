It's a little crowded in this area for me.
Yes, that is much better.
It's too close to the restrooms.
Yes, this table will work fine.
This one will be perfect.
No, I like to sit where I can see the front door.
It's so small.
Can we get a table a little further away?
Yes, this is fine.
It doesn't seem to have enough chairs.
It's very drafty.
Can we get a booth instead?
I guess it's fine.
It's too near the window.
