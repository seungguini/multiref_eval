Okay, I'll teach you.
Why do you say that?
Why are swim classes embarrassing?
Why are they embarassing?
Do you think they're going to put you with little kids?
You have nothing to be embarrassed about.
I suppose I could teach you.
You ought to learn one way or another.
I don't have the time, sorry.
Nobody's even paying attention.
I could. Meet me at the pool at 1:00 tomorrow.
How much are you willing to pay me?
You're being much too over sensitive.
Sorry, I don't know how to swim either.
They're embarrassing for everyone, so you'll be embarrassed together.
You need to get over yourself.
Let's take the class together.
