Why are swim classes embarrassing?
Do you think they're going to put you with little kids?
You have nothing to be embarrassed about.
You ought to learn one way or another.
I could. Meet me at the pool at 1:00 tomorrow.
How much are you willing to pay me?
Sorry, I don't know how to swim either.
You need to get over yourself.
