Why are swim classes embarrassing?
Why are they embarassing?
I don't have the time, sorry.
Nobody's even paying attention.
I could. Meet me at the pool at 1:00 tomorrow.
How much are you willing to pay me?
Sorry, I don't know how to swim either.
They're embarrassing for everyone, so you'll be embarrassed together.
