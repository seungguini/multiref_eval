Okay, I'll teach you.
Do you think they're going to put you with little kids?
You have nothing to be embarrassed about.
You ought to learn one way or another.
I could. Meet me at the pool at 1:00 tomorrow.
How much are you willing to pay me?
Sorry, I don't know how to swim either.
They're embarrassing for everyone, so you'll be embarrassed together.
