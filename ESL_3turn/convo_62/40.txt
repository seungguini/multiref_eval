Why do you say that?
Why are swim classes embarrassing?
Do you think they're going to put you with little kids?
You have nothing to be embarrassed about.
You ought to learn one way or another.
I don't have the time, sorry.
Sorry, I don't know how to swim either.
They're embarrassing for everyone, so you'll be embarrassed together.
