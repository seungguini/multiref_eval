Its busy tonight.
Just relax.
It's really busy here.
Well, it is pretty packed.
Well he is on his way now.
Please don't make a scene.
Maybe he's new.
It's a full house.
Your right, its unacceptable.
Be nice to him.
Yeah, and I'm starving.
I think he's new.
He looks like he's working hard.
I told you we should've gone to sushi instead.
Well he will get a small tip then.
At least he's here now.
You wanted to eat out tonight.
