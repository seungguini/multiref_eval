Have you read it?
Yes everyone loves it.
You'll enjoy it!
Most people read the book and then watch the movie;.
It's very popular with teenagers.
The book is always much better than the movie in my opinion, the movie left so much stuff out.
I couldn't get through it myself.
I don't understand the appeal.
