The book is so much better than the movie.
You'll enjoy it!
Most people read the book and then watch the movie;.
The book is always much better than the movie in my opinion, the movie left so much stuff out.
Did you see the movie?
I couldn't get through it myself.
We do not currently have any copies available; it will be about 2 weeks.
You might want to check with another library.
