The book is so much better than the movie.
Have you read it?
I love this book, you'll enjoy reading it.
Most people read the book and then watch the movie;.
It's very popular with teenagers.
The book is always much better than the movie in my opinion, the movie left so much stuff out.
You might want to check with another library.
It seems boring to me.
