I read the book too.
Most people read the book and then watch the movie;.
It's very popular with teenagers.
The book is always much better than the movie in my opinion, the movie left so much stuff out.
Did you see the movie?
I couldn't get through it myself.
I don't understand the appeal.
You might want to check with another library.
