I read the book too.
Yes everyone loves it.
You'll enjoy it!
Most people read the book and then watch the movie;.
The book is always much better than the movie in my opinion, the movie left so much stuff out.
I don't understand the appeal.
You might want to check with another library.
It seems boring to me.
