Yes everyone loves it.
I love this book, you'll enjoy reading it.
You'll enjoy it!
The book is always much better than the movie in my opinion, the movie left so much stuff out.
Did you see the movie?
I couldn't get through it myself.
We do not currently have any copies available; it will be about 2 weeks.
It seems boring to me.
