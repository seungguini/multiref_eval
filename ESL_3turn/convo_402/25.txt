The book is so much better than the movie.
Most people read the book and then watch the movie;.
It's very popular with teenagers.
The book is always much better than the movie in my opinion, the movie left so much stuff out.
Did you see the movie?
We do not currently have any copies available; it will be about 2 weeks.
You might want to check with another library.
It seems boring to me.
