I read the book too.
Yes everyone loves it.
I love this book, you'll enjoy reading it.
Most people read the book and then watch the movie;.
The book is always much better than the movie in my opinion, the movie left so much stuff out.
Did you see the movie?
You might want to check with another library.
It seems boring to me.
