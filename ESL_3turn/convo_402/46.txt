I read the book too.
You'll enjoy it!
The book is always much better than the movie in my opinion, the movie left so much stuff out.
Did you see the movie?
I couldn't get through it myself.
We do not currently have any copies available; it will be about 2 weeks.
I don't understand the appeal.
You might want to check with another library.
