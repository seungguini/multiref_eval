The book is so much better than the movie.
Have you read it?
I read the book too.
Yes everyone loves it.
I love this book, you'll enjoy reading it.
You'll enjoy it!
Most people read the book and then watch the movie;.
It's very popular with teenagers.
The book is always much better than the movie in my opinion, the movie left so much stuff out.
Did you see the movie?
I couldn't get through it myself.
We do not currently have any copies available; it will be about 2 weeks.
I don't understand the appeal.
You might want to check with another library.
It seems boring to me.
