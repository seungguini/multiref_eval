I read the book too.
I love this book, you'll enjoy reading it.
The book is always much better than the movie in my opinion, the movie left so much stuff out.
Did you see the movie?
We do not currently have any copies available; it will be about 2 weeks.
I don't understand the appeal.
You might want to check with another library.
It seems boring to me.
