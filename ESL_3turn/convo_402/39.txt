The book is so much better than the movie.
I love this book, you'll enjoy reading it.
Most people read the book and then watch the movie;.
It's very popular with teenagers.
We do not currently have any copies available; it will be about 2 weeks.
I don't understand the appeal.
You might want to check with another library.
It seems boring to me.
