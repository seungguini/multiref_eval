The book is so much better than the movie.
I read the book too.
Yes everyone loves it.
I love this book, you'll enjoy reading it.
It's very popular with teenagers.
The book is always much better than the movie in my opinion, the movie left so much stuff out.
I don't understand the appeal.
It seems boring to me.
