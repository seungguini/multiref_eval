The book is so much better than the movie.
I read the book too.
I love this book, you'll enjoy reading it.
Most people read the book and then watch the movie;.
The book is always much better than the movie in my opinion, the movie left so much stuff out.
I couldn't get through it myself.
We do not currently have any copies available; it will be about 2 weeks.
It seems boring to me.
