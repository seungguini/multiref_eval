Have you read it?
I read the book too.
Yes everyone loves it.
I love this book, you'll enjoy reading it.
The book is always much better than the movie in my opinion, the movie left so much stuff out.
We do not currently have any copies available; it will be about 2 weeks.
I don't understand the appeal.
You might want to check with another library.
