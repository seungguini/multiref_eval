I read the book too.
Yes everyone loves it.
I love this book, you'll enjoy reading it.
You'll enjoy it!
Most people read the book and then watch the movie;.
The book is always much better than the movie in my opinion, the movie left so much stuff out.
I don't understand the appeal.
It seems boring to me.
