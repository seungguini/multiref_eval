Have you read it?
You'll enjoy it!
Most people read the book and then watch the movie;.
The book is always much better than the movie in my opinion, the movie left so much stuff out.
Did you see the movie?
I couldn't get through it myself.
You might want to check with another library.
It seems boring to me.
