Have you read it?
I love this book, you'll enjoy reading it.
You'll enjoy it!
Most people read the book and then watch the movie;.
The book is always much better than the movie in my opinion, the movie left so much stuff out.
I couldn't get through it myself.
You might want to check with another library.
It seems boring to me.
