Have you read it?
Yes everyone loves it.
Most people read the book and then watch the movie;.
It's very popular with teenagers.
The book is always much better than the movie in my opinion, the movie left so much stuff out.
We do not currently have any copies available; it will be about 2 weeks.
I don't understand the appeal.
It seems boring to me.
