What area were you interested in?
Well, where have you looked so far?
I'm pretty busy for the next two days. I can help you on Saturday.
What do you have so far?
Do you have enough saved up?
Are you scared to move out of your parents' place?
Do you have any ideas about where you'd like to live?
Can your boyfriend help you out?
