What area were you interested in?
Well, where have you looked so far?
I'm pretty busy for the next two days. I can help you on Saturday.
What do you have so far?
Do you have enough saved up?
Have you looked at anything at all yet?
Have you thought about sharing an apartment?
Why don't you want to stay in the dorms?
