Why are you having trouble?
I'm pretty busy for the next two days. I can help you on Saturday.
Can you show me what you've been trying to do?
What do you have so far?
Do you have enough saved up?
The search function can be a little tricky.
Do you have any ideas about where you'd like to live?
Why don't you want to stay in the dorms?
