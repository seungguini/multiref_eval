Well, where have you looked so far?
I'm pretty busy for the next two days. I can help you on Saturday.
Do you have enough saved up?
Have you looked at anything at all yet?
The search function can be a little tricky.
Are you scared to move out of your parents' place?
Do you have any ideas about where you'd like to live?
Why don't you want to stay in the dorms?
