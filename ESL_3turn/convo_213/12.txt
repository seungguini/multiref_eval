Well, where have you looked so far?
Why are you having trouble?
I'm pretty busy for the next two days. I can help you on Saturday.
Can you show me what you've been trying to do?
Do you have enough saved up?
Are you scared to move out of your parents' place?
Can your boyfriend help you out?
Why don't you want to stay in the dorms?
