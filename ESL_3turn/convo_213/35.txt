What area were you interested in?
Well, where have you looked so far?
I'm pretty busy for the next two days. I can help you on Saturday.
What do you have so far?
Are you scared to move out of your parents' place?
Have you thought about sharing an apartment?
Can your boyfriend help you out?
Why don't you want to stay in the dorms?
