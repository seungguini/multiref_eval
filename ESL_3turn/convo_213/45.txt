Well, where have you looked so far?
I'm pretty busy for the next two days. I can help you on Saturday.
Can you show me what you've been trying to do?
What do you have so far?
The search function can be a little tricky.
Are you scared to move out of your parents' place?
Can your boyfriend help you out?
Why don't you want to stay in the dorms?
