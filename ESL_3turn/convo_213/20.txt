I'm pretty busy for the next two days. I can help you on Saturday.
What do you have so far?
Do you have enough saved up?
Have you looked at anything at all yet?
You'll be fine.  I'll help you with leads and go with you to look at them.
Have you thought about sharing an apartment?
Can your boyfriend help you out?
Why don't you want to stay in the dorms?
