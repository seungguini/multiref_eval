I'm pretty busy for the next two days. I can help you on Saturday.
Can you show me what you've been trying to do?
Have you looked at anything at all yet?
Are you scared to move out of your parents' place?
Do you have any ideas about where you'd like to live?
You'll be fine.  I'll help you with leads and go with you to look at them.
Can your boyfriend help you out?
Why don't you want to stay in the dorms?
