Well, where have you looked so far?
Why are you having trouble?
I'm pretty busy for the next two days. I can help you on Saturday.
Do you have enough saved up?
Have you looked at anything at all yet?
Are you scared to move out of your parents' place?
Have you thought about sharing an apartment?
Why don't you want to stay in the dorms?
