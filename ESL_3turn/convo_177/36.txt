Let's go there first. I need new shoes anyway.
That just opened up.
Malls are so boring! Let's go somewhere more interesting, like the antique store.
I didn't there was a shopping mall nearby.
That's the biggest mall in the state.
Or we could go to Ikea.
I love shopping!
I do need some new clothes.
