Let's go there first. I need new shoes anyway.
We should go there and buy a few things.
Shopping malls are everywhere.
Malls are so boring! Let's go somewhere more interesting, like the antique store.
That's the biggest mall in the state.
Or we could go to Ikea.
I love shopping!
We should go check that out.
