Let's go there first. I need new shoes anyway.
We should go there and buy a few things.
Malls are so boring! Let's go somewhere more interesting, like the antique store.
Or we could go to Ikea.
We should go check that out.
I hope they have a good food court!
We should go check it out right now!
I do need some new clothes.
