Let's go there first. I need new shoes anyway.
We should go there and buy a few things.
Shopping malls are everywhere.
That just opened up.
Malls are so boring! Let's go somewhere more interesting, like the antique store.
I didn't there was a shopping mall nearby.
I thought you meant something more outdoorsy
That's the biggest mall in the state.
Or we could go to Ikea.
I love shopping!
We should go check that out.
I hope they have a good food court!
The girls would have so much fun there.
We should go check it out right now!
I do need some new clothes.
