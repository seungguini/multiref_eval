We should go there and buy a few things.
Shopping malls are everywhere.
Malls are so boring! Let's go somewhere more interesting, like the antique store.
That's the biggest mall in the state.
We should go check that out.
I hope they have a good food court!
We should go check it out right now!
I do need some new clothes.
