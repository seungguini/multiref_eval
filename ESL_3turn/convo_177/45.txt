Malls are so boring! Let's go somewhere more interesting, like the antique store.
I didn't there was a shopping mall nearby.
I thought you meant something more outdoorsy
Or we could go to Ikea.
I love shopping!
I hope they have a good food court!
The girls would have so much fun there.
We should go check it out right now!
