Ms. Miller is just doing her job.
She's just trying to make you guys smarter.
You'll get in trouble.
That's not going to make things better.
That doesn't matter, don't be a jerk.
That would be funny.
Ooh, that's funny, do it.
That's an awful thing to do, I think you should be honest with her and not put gum in her hair.
