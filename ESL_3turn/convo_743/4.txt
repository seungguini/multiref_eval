Ms. Miller is just doing her job.
She's just trying to make you guys smarter.
You'll get in trouble.
That's not going to make things better.
Maybe you should talk to her before doing something that might get you in trouble.
That doesn't matter, don't be a jerk.
That would be funny.
That's an awful thing to do, I think you should be honest with her and not put gum in her hair.
