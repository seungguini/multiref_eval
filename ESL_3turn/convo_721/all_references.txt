My car broke down a street over!
It wasn't even supposed to rain.
You are a life saver!
I don't know when it's going to stop!
Can I use your phone?
It was so nice an hour ago.
You saved me.
I can't even drive my car!
Do you have a towel?
I didn't know it was supposed to rain.
It's up to my ankles!
Thanks again, I appreciate your help.
I'm so wet!
It hasn't rained like this in years.
The tornado is worse!
It's so gross outside!
How the heck are we gonna go to the party now?
