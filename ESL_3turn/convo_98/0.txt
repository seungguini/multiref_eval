There's a lot of reasons to vote.
I often feel that way too.
Every vote counts.
Every voice counts.
If everyone felt that way, voting would mean nothing.
It's good to have your voice heard even though you're just one of millions.
I know what you mean; my candidate never seems to win anyway.
If you want things to change, it's your duty to vote.
