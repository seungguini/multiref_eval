There's a lot of reasons to vote.
Every vote counts.
If everyone felt that way, voting would mean nothing.
Even if it doesn't seem like it you should vote.
I know what you mean; my candidate never seems to win anyway.
Every vote makes a difference.
What if everyone said that?
If you want things to change, it's your duty to vote.
