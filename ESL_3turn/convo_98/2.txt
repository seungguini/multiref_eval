There's a lot of reasons to vote.
I often feel that way too.
Every voice counts.
It's good to have your voice heard even though you're just one of millions.
Even if it doesn't seem like it you should vote.
I know what you mean; my candidate never seems to win anyway.
Every vote makes a difference.
If you want things to change, it's your duty to vote.
