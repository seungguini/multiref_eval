There's a lot of reasons to vote.
Every vote counts.
Every voice counts.
If everyone felt that way, voting would mean nothing.
It's good to have your voice heard even though you're just one of millions.
Even if it doesn't seem like it you should vote.
Every vote makes a difference.
What if everyone said that?
