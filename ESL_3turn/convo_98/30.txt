Every vote counts.
If everyone felt that way, voting would mean nothing.
It's good to have your voice heard even though you're just one of millions.
Even if it doesn't seem like it you should vote.
I know what you mean; my candidate never seems to win anyway.
Every vote makes a difference.
What if everyone said that?
If you want things to change, it's your duty to vote.
