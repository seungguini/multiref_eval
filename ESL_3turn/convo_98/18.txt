There's a lot of reasons to vote.
I often feel that way too.
Every vote counts.
Every voice counts.
It's good to have your voice heard even though you're just one of millions.
Even if it doesn't seem like it you should vote.
What if everyone said that?
If you want things to change, it's your duty to vote.
