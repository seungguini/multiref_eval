I wish I could visit.
Are you seriously considering moving there?
Maybe if you are lucky you can live their one day.
I know. Every time I go on vacation, I feel the same way.
It sounds like you had a great time.
Go for it!  You only live once.
I heard it's beautiful!
Hawaii must have been breathtaking.
