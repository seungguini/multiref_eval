I wish I could visit.
Are you seriously considering moving there?
Maybe if you are lucky you can live their one day.
I heard it's really expensive to live there.
Are you going to move?
I know. Every time I go on vacation, I feel the same way.
Go for it!  You only live once.
Hawaii sounds absolutely lovely.
