I wish I could visit.
Are you seriously considering moving there?
I heard it's really expensive to live there.
I know. Every time I go on vacation, I feel the same way.
It sounds like you had a great time.
I heard it's beautiful!
Hawaii must have been breathtaking.
Did you go to the beach everyday?
