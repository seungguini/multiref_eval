No. It's not that loud.
Ok, but if you had given me back my ear buds, I could listen to it without bothering you.
Why don't you just go in the other room?
Okay.
I will turn it down.
I'm sorry if my music is bothering you, don't you have headphones you could put on, to drown out my noise?
But this is my favorite song!
No. I will not turn it down.
