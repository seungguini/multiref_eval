Sorry.
Ok, but if you had given me back my ear buds, I could listen to it without bothering you.
Okay.
I will turn it down.
I'm sorry if my music is bothering you, don't you have headphones you could put on, to drown out my noise?
Is there anything you would like to listen to?
No. I will not turn it down.
I'll turn it off.
