So you dislike him because he's dirty and old?
Did he do something to you?
What does that mean?
Has he done anything to bother you specifically?
He looks like it.
Maybe he's having a rough time and needs some help.
He could use a shower, but he doesn't really bother me.
I know, right! I don't like dirty old men either.
