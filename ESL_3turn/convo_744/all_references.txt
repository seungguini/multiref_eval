So you dislike him because he's dirty and old?
Did he do something to you?
You don't know that.
What does that mean?
Has he done anything to bother you specifically?
He looks like it.
Why do you say that?
How so?
Maybe he's having a rough time and needs some help.
What does he do?
He could use a shower, but he doesn't really bother me.
I know, right! I don't like dirty old men either.
