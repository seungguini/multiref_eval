I wish I could, but I'm from out of town.
I don't know anything about the buses.
Where are you headed?
Sure. What stop is near your house?
Where are you trying to go to?
Let me pull up my gps.
I am not familiar with the bus routes. You may want to use the bus app on the phone.
Can you tell me your destination?
