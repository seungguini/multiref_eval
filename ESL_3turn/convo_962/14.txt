I don't know anything about the buses.
Okay, you go around the corner to the C bus.
Sure. What stop is near your house?
Where are you trying to go to?
Let me pull up my gps.
I am not familiar with the bus routes. You may want to use the bus app on the phone.
You have to go online to find out.
Maybe I can help you but I'm not sure.
