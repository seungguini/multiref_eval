I don't know anything about the buses.
Okay, you go around the corner to the C bus.
Where are you headed?
Sure. What stop is near your house?
Where are you trying to go to?
I am not familiar with the bus routes. You may want to use the bus app on the phone.
Can you tell me your destination?
Maybe I can help you but I'm not sure.
