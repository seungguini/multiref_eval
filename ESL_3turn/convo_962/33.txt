I don't know anything about the buses.
Where are you headed?
Sure. What stop is near your house?
Let me pull up my gps.
I am not familiar with the bus routes. You may want to use the bus app on the phone.
Can you tell me your destination?
You have to go online to find out.
Maybe I can help you but I'm not sure.
