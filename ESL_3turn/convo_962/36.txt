I wish I could, but I'm from out of town.
I don't know anything about the buses.
Where are you headed?
Sure. What stop is near your house?
Let me pull up my gps.
I am not familiar with the bus routes. You may want to use the bus app on the phone.
You have to go online to find out.
Maybe I can help you but I'm not sure.
