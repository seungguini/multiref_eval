I can't help you with that.
Depends on where you want to go.
Call the bus stop station.
Just read instructions.
I'm not sure about that.
I have no idea.
Since you live in the next block, so you wait here.
Ask your fellow commuters.
It's a little confusing.
Ask the person sitting next to you.
I'm afraid I would get you last.
We have the waiting stop. So follow me.
I'm the wrong person to ask.
Ask the buss driver.
