I think that the paint job is very ugly.
The paint is peeling.
Its too small.
Something about it just rubs me the wrong way.
I think that architecture is weird.
It's too far away.
I do not like the color.
I think it's creepy.
It isn't very unique looking.
Look how big the yard is?
It's just too big.
I think the neighbors houses are too close; I do not like th neighborhood.
Didn't you hear about what happened here?
Its too expensive.
I can't explain it.
