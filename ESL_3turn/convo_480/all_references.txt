I do not like boiled peanuts.
I don't think I've ever had those.
Yuck, boiled peanuts are gross.
Ew. Those are the worst.
I like Planters the best.
That sounds kind of disgusting.
Boiled peanuts are popular in the south.
But they're so mushy that way.
You always like to be different don't you?
That's an unusual thing to eat.
They make me so thirsty though.
