I fly for business occasionally.
Can you please leave me alone!
Take the hint bud, I don't want to talk.
I don't mean to be rude but I'd prefer not to talk.
No, this flight is for pleasure.
That's not your business.
Please do not talk to me.
I am sorry, but I really want to take a nap on this flight.
