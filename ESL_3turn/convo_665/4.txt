If you don't mind I think I'm just going to go to sleep.
I fly for business occasionally.
Take the hint bud, I don't want to talk.
I don't mean to be rude but I'd prefer not to talk.
Yes that's right.
Please shut up!
No, this flight is for pleasure.
I am sorry, but I really want to take a nap on this flight.
