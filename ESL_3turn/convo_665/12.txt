If you don't mind I think I'm just going to go to sleep.
I fly for business occasionally.
I don't mean to be rude but I'd prefer not to talk.
No I am not.
No, this flight is for pleasure.
That's not your business.
Please do not talk to me.
I am sorry, but I really want to take a nap on this flight.
