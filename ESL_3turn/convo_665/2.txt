If you don't mind I think I'm just going to go to sleep.
I fly for business occasionally.
Can you please leave me alone!
Take the hint bud, I don't want to talk.
You are correct!
No, this flight is for pleasure.
No, just going on vacation.
I am sorry, but I really want to take a nap on this flight.
