How much do they cost now?
I know it was, it was never that cheap whenever I tried to buy them.
I miss it.
Well, we have the internet now.
I wonder why they have become so expensive.
Yeah, my grandma always complains about how cheap they used to be.
I guess I'm old, haha.
Given time, everything becomes more expensive.
