I guess we're just a couple of bachelors out on the town, then.
Have you ever been in a relationship?
Shame on us.
Maybe we should go out some time.
Girlfriends are annoying.
Do you want to go to the bar to meet some women?
Really? I thought I saw you with a girl at the movies last week.
I'm actually gay, what about you?
