I guess we're just a couple of bachelors out on the town, then.
Have you ever been in a relationship?
Shame on us.
Oh, I thought I saw you with someone yesterday.
Maybe we should go out some time.
Do you want to go to the bar to meet some women?
Really? I thought I saw you with a girl at the movies last week.
I think I'll set up a dating website account.
