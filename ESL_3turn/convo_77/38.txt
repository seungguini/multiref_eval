Have you ever been in a relationship?
Oh, I thought I saw you with someone yesterday.
I hate being single. How about you?
Girlfriends are annoying.
Do you want to go to the bar to meet some women?
Really? I thought I saw you with a girl at the movies last week.
I think I'll set up a dating website account.
I'm actually gay, what about you?
