Have you ever been in a relationship?
Shame on us.
I hate being single. How about you?
Maybe we should go out some time.
Girlfriends are annoying.
Do you want to go to the bar to meet some women?
Really? I thought I saw you with a girl at the movies last week.
I think I'll set up a dating website account.
