I guess we're just a couple of bachelors out on the town, then.
Have you ever been in a relationship?
Shame on us.
Oh, I thought I saw you with someone yesterday.
I hate being single. How about you?
Girlfriends are annoying.
Do you want to go to the bar to meet some women?
I'm actually gay, what about you?
