I guess we're just a couple of bachelors out on the town, then.
Shame on us.
Oh, I thought I saw you with someone yesterday.
I hate being single. How about you?
Maybe we should go out some time.
Really? I thought I saw you with a girl at the movies last week.
I think I'll set up a dating website account.
I'm actually gay, what about you?
