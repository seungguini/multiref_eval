I know but I want to make sure I get in somewhere.
Just covering my bases!
I'm worried if I apply to too few, I won't get in anywhere.
I have been told that it is very competitive.
It is; the applications are lengthy and expensive too.
I want to know what my options are.
No I can't help myself, I'm paranoid.
They are all talk schools.
