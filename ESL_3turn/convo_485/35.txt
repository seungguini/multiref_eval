I wanna make sure I get into some place that I like.
Just covering my bases!
I'm worried if I apply to too few, I won't get in anywhere.
It is; the applications are lengthy and expensive too.
I want to know what my options are.
Yes I'm probably overdoing it.
No I can't help myself, I'm paranoid.
They are all talk schools.
