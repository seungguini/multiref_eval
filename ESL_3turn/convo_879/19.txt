I like my salads with lots of feta.
I like caesar salads because of the dressing.
I like a really big one.
I like the fruit salad that McDonalds offers.
I order salads with little to no vegetables and more dressing.
I agree, I don't like extra things in my salad.
I only eat lettuce salads, I can't stand other flavors mixing.
Do you make your own?
