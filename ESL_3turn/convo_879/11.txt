I like caesar salads because of the dressing.
I like a really big one.
I'm into macaroni salads.
I enjoy complicated salads, the more vegetables the merrier!
I like the fruit salad that McDonalds offers.
I order salads with little to no vegetables and more dressing.
I agree, I don't like extra things in my salad.
Have you ever had the salads in the cafeteria?
