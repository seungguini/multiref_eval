I like my salads with lots of feta.
I like a really big one.
I'm into macaroni salads.
As long as they put feta I'm good.
I like the fruit salad that McDonalds offers.
Have you ever had the salads in the cafeteria?
I only eat lettuce salads, I can't stand other flavors mixing.
Do you make your own?
