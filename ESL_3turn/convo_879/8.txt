I like my salads with lots of feta.
I like caesar salads because of the dressing.
I like a really big one.
As long as they put feta I'm good.
I enjoy complicated salads, the more vegetables the merrier!
Like which kind?
I like the fruit salad that McDonalds offers.
I order salads with little to no vegetables and more dressing.
