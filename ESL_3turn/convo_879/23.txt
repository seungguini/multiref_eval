I like caesar salads because of the dressing.
I like a really big one.
I'm into macaroni salads.
I enjoy complicated salads, the more vegetables the merrier!
Like which kind?
I order salads with little to no vegetables and more dressing.
Do you like avocado?
I agree, I don't like extra things in my salad.
