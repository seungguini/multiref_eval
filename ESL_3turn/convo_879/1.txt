I like my salads with lots of feta.
I like caesar salads because of the dressing.
As long as they put feta I'm good.
I enjoy complicated salads, the more vegetables the merrier!
Like which kind?
I order salads with little to no vegetables and more dressing.
I only eat lettuce salads, I can't stand other flavors mixing.
Do you make your own?
