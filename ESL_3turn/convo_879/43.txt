I like my salads with lots of feta.
I like caesar salads because of the dressing.
I like a really big one.
I'm into macaroni salads.
As long as they put feta I'm good.
I order salads with little to no vegetables and more dressing.
Do you like avocado?
I only eat lettuce salads, I can't stand other flavors mixing.
