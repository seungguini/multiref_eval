I'm into macaroni salads.
I enjoy complicated salads, the more vegetables the merrier!
Like which kind?
I like the fruit salad that McDonalds offers.
I order salads with little to no vegetables and more dressing.
Do you like avocado?
I agree, I don't like extra things in my salad.
Have you ever had the salads in the cafeteria?
