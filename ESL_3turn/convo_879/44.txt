I like caesar salads because of the dressing.
Like which kind?
I like the fruit salad that McDonalds offers.
I order salads with little to no vegetables and more dressing.
Do you like avocado?
Have you ever had the salads in the cafeteria?
I only eat lettuce salads, I can't stand other flavors mixing.
Do you make your own?
