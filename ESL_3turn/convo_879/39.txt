I like caesar salads because of the dressing.
As long as they put feta I'm good.
I enjoy complicated salads, the more vegetables the merrier!
I like the fruit salad that McDonalds offers.
I agree, I don't like extra things in my salad.
Have you ever had the salads in the cafeteria?
I only eat lettuce salads, I can't stand other flavors mixing.
Do you make your own?
