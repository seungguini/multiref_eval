I can't imagine anyone who would.
I'm enjoying the class, though.
I think it will be a good class.
Was it a requirement for your major?
Same here.   This isn't relevant to my degree.
I would still take the class regardless.
I'm interested in languages though.
I hate the sound of the Spanish language.
