Yes some guy at the bar hit me!
No I got attacked.
It was an accident.
No, I was playing baseball with my son and he accidentally hit me in the face!
You know very well what happened.
Some girl just walked up and hit me for talking to her boyfriend.
No some stranger just randomly came up to me and punched me.
Yeah, I beat him up good.
