I'm on American Airlines and it's terminal B.
THanks for picking me up
Ok I will.
I really don't mind taking an Uber so that you don't have to come so early.
That's going to be Air France and I think it's terminal C.
I'm flying in on Delta airlines to Terminal B.
I'm flying on Eastern and I'll have to let you know what the terminal is.
I thought you had a class in the morning?
