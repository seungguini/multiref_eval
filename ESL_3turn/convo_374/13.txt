Its ok its really early.
Are you sure you want to come so early in the morning?
I'll be coming in on Southwest, I'm not sure which terminal.
THanks for picking me up
I really don't mind taking an Uber so that you don't have to come so early.
That's going to be Air France and I think it's terminal C.
I'm flying in on Delta airlines to Terminal B.
I thought you had a class in the morning?
