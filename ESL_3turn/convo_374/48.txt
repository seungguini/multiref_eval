I'm on American Airlines and it's terminal B.
I'll text it.
Are you sure you want to come so early in the morning?
THanks for picking me up
Ok I will.
That's going to be Air France and I think it's terminal C.
I'm flying in on Delta airlines to Terminal B.
I'm flying on Eastern and I'll have to let you know what the terminal is.
