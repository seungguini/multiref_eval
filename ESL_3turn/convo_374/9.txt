Its ok its really early.
I'll be coming in on Southwest, I'm not sure which terminal.
THanks for picking me up
That's going to be Air France and I think it's terminal C.
It's Ponderosa Airlines, that's all I know.
I'm flying in on Delta airlines to Terminal B.
I'm flying on Eastern and I'll have to let you know what the terminal is.
