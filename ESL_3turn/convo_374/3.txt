I'll text it.
Its ok its really early.
I'll be coming in on Southwest, I'm not sure which terminal.
THanks for picking me up
You are so nice to offer to pick me up!
It's Ponderosa Airlines, that's all I know.
I'm flying on Eastern and I'll have to let you know what the terminal is.
I thought you had a class in the morning?
