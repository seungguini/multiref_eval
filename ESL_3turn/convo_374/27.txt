I'm on American Airlines and it's terminal B.
I'll text it.
Its ok its really early.
I'll be coming in on Southwest, I'm not sure which terminal.
Ok I will.
I really don't mind taking an Uber so that you don't have to come so early.
You are so nice to offer to pick me up!
I'm flying on Eastern and I'll have to let you know what the terminal is.
