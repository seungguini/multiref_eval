I'm on American Airlines and it's terminal B.
Are you sure you want to come so early in the morning?
I'll be coming in on Southwest, I'm not sure which terminal.
Ok I will.
That's going to be Air France and I think it's terminal C.
You are so nice to offer to pick me up!
I'm flying in on Delta airlines to Terminal B.
I thought you had a class in the morning?
