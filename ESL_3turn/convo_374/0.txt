I'm on American Airlines and it's terminal B.
I'll text it.
Its ok its really early.
Are you sure you want to come so early in the morning?
I'll be coming in on Southwest, I'm not sure which terminal.
You are so nice to offer to pick me up!
It's Ponderosa Airlines, that's all I know.
I thought you had a class in the morning?
