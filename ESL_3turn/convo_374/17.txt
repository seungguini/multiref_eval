I'm on American Airlines and it's terminal B.
I'll text it.
Its ok its really early.
Are you sure you want to come so early in the morning?
That's going to be Air France and I think it's terminal C.
It's Ponderosa Airlines, that's all I know.
I'm flying in on Delta airlines to Terminal B.
I'm flying on Eastern and I'll have to let you know what the terminal is.
