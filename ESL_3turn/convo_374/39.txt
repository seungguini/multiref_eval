I'm on American Airlines and it's terminal B.
Are you sure you want to come so early in the morning?
I'll be coming in on Southwest, I'm not sure which terminal.
Ok I will.
I really don't mind taking an Uber so that you don't have to come so early.
That's going to be Air France and I think it's terminal C.
It's Ponderosa Airlines, that's all I know.
I'm flying in on Delta airlines to Terminal B.
