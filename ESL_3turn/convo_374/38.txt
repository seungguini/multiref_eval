I'll text it.
Are you sure you want to come so early in the morning?
I'll be coming in on Southwest, I'm not sure which terminal.
THanks for picking me up
Ok I will.
That's going to be Air France and I think it's terminal C.
You are so nice to offer to pick me up!
It's Ponderosa Airlines, that's all I know.
