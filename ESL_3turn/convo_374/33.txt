I'll text it.
Are you sure you want to come so early in the morning?
THanks for picking me up
I really don't mind taking an Uber so that you don't have to come so early.
That's going to be Air France and I think it's terminal C.
You are so nice to offer to pick me up!
It's Ponderosa Airlines, that's all I know.
I'm flying on Eastern and I'll have to let you know what the terminal is.
