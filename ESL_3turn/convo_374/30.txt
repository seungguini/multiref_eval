I'm on American Airlines and it's terminal B.
I'll text it.
Ok I will.
I really don't mind taking an Uber so that you don't have to come so early.
You are so nice to offer to pick me up!
It's Ponderosa Airlines, that's all I know.
I'm flying on Eastern and I'll have to let you know what the terminal is.
I thought you had a class in the morning?
