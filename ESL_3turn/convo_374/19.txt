I'm on American Airlines and it's terminal B.
I'll text it.
Its ok its really early.
I'll be coming in on Southwest, I'm not sure which terminal.
That's going to be Air France and I think it's terminal C.
You are so nice to offer to pick me up!
It's Ponderosa Airlines, that's all I know.
I'm flying in on Delta airlines to Terminal B.
