Its ok its really early.
Are you sure you want to come so early in the morning?
I'll be coming in on Southwest, I'm not sure which terminal.
THanks for picking me up
I really don't mind taking an Uber so that you don't have to come so early.
You are so nice to offer to pick me up!
It's Ponderosa Airlines, that's all I know.
I'm flying on Eastern and I'll have to let you know what the terminal is.
