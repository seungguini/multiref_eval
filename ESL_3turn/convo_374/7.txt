I'll text it.
I'll be coming in on Southwest, I'm not sure which terminal.
THanks for picking me up
Ok I will.
I really don't mind taking an Uber so that you don't have to come so early.
You are so nice to offer to pick me up!
I'm flying on Eastern and I'll have to let you know what the terminal is.
I thought you had a class in the morning?
