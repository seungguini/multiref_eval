Are you sure you want to come so early in the morning?
I'll be coming in on Southwest, I'm not sure which terminal.
Ok I will.
That's going to be Air France and I think it's terminal C.
You are so nice to offer to pick me up!
I'm flying in on Delta airlines to Terminal B.
I'm flying on Eastern and I'll have to let you know what the terminal is.
I thought you had a class in the morning?
