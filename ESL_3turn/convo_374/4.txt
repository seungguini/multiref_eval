I'm on American Airlines and it's terminal B.
I'll text it.
THanks for picking me up
Ok I will.
It's Ponderosa Airlines, that's all I know.
I'm flying in on Delta airlines to Terminal B.
I'm flying on Eastern and I'll have to let you know what the terminal is.
I thought you had a class in the morning?
