Are you sure you want to come so early in the morning?
I'll be coming in on Southwest, I'm not sure which terminal.
THanks for picking me up
Ok I will.
I really don't mind taking an Uber so that you don't have to come so early.
It's Ponderosa Airlines, that's all I know.
I'm flying on Eastern and I'll have to let you know what the terminal is.
I thought you had a class in the morning?
