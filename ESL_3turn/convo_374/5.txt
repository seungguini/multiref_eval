I'm on American Airlines and it's terminal B.
I'll text it.
Are you sure you want to come so early in the morning?
I'll be coming in on Southwest, I'm not sure which terminal.
Ok I will.
I really don't mind taking an Uber so that you don't have to come so early.
You are so nice to offer to pick me up!
I thought you had a class in the morning?
