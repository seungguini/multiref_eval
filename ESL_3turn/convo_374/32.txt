I'm on American Airlines and it's terminal B.
Its ok its really early.
Are you sure you want to come so early in the morning?
THanks for picking me up
I really don't mind taking an Uber so that you don't have to come so early.
That's going to be Air France and I think it's terminal C.
It's Ponderosa Airlines, that's all I know.
I thought you had a class in the morning?
