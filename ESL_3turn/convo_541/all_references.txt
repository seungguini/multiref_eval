A tap card pays for all my bus trips for thirty days.
It's a card you use instead of a ticket.
It's like food stamps for buses.
It allows me to pay at the end of the month.
You can get one at the transit office.
It's too complicated to explain.
A card that you tap on the bus and it lets you ride for free.
It is like a ticket but they withdraw the money right out of my account for me.
