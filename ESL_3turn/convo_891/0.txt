I'm so surprised to hear that. I know they have been having trouble conceiving.
Oh wow, that is great news.
Really that's wonderful news.
Really? Who would've guessed!
Well, technically Michelle is the one who's pregnant.
Is it a boy or girl?
I can't believe it.
How wonderful! I need to call and congratulate them.
