I'm so surprised to hear that. I know they have been having trouble conceiving.
Oh wow, that is great news.
Well, technically Michelle is the one who's pregnant.
Is it a boy or girl?
How exciting hope they have a girl.
I can't believe it.
How wonderful! I need to call and congratulate them.
Wow, how far along are they?
