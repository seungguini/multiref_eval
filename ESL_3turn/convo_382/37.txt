I have one you can borrow.
Better get another one then.
Throw it away and get a new one.
Well, I have an extra pen if you want it.
Here, borrow mine then.
Well, that's the last of our stock. I'll go get more.
There are multiple pens right behind you.
I'll take you to Staples to get some pens after work.
