Oh I've seen you before!
Oh, that's right. I didn't recognize you!
Oh I remember you.
THANK YOU. HOW ARE YOU?
Ah yes, you brought gushers for a snack last week.
Do they play on the same soccer team or baseball team?
So nice to meet you again.
It's so nice to meet you!
It's so nice to meet you! I'm David's mother.
You excited about the game.
I hardly recognized you!
The boys seem to get along really well.
Glad you can come.
Is James the goalie?
We talked on the phone briefly.
It's gonna be a great game.
