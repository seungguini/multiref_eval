OH JAMES MOM,NICE TO MEET YOU
Oh, that's right. I didn't recognize you!
Ah yes, you brought gushers for a snack last week.
Do they play on the same soccer team or baseball team?
It's so nice to meet you! I'm David's mother.
I hardly recognized you!
Glad you can come.
We talked on the phone briefly.
