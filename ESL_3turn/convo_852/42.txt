Oh, that's right. I didn't recognize you!
Ah yes, you brought gushers for a snack last week.
Do they play on the same soccer team or baseball team?
It's so nice to meet you! I'm David's mother.
You excited about the game.
The boys seem to get along really well.
Glad you can come.
Is James the goalie?
