Let me call my bank and verify.
There has to be some kind of mistake.
I just checked my balance on my phone.
I will contact my bank.
Thanks, Captain Obvious.
Who asked you?
I have a lot of money in there, there's no way.
What other forms of payment do you accept?
Here try this credit card instead.
No, I think it's my card.
Can I pay by check?
That's ok, I'll pay with cash.
Just try it again.
I will use a different card.
Alright well then i'll use my credit card.
