Okay, I'll drop by later and give it to you.
Is it the oak tree you want to cut down?
That tree is too big for my chainsaw.
Okay come over and I will give it to you.
Which tree did you want to cut down?
I'm afraid you will hurt yourself.
Do you know what you're doing?
You'll have to wait until George brings it back.
