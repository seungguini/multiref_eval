do you think it helps?
Thanks, I thought of it.
I just saw a child licking this, so.
Yes, these are sanitizing wipes.
maybe, but I think the store should be responsible for clean carts
You can pick up a travel pack of these wipes to keep in your purse.
of course it is, I am a genius afterall
I always keep these wipes with me.
