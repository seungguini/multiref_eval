do you think it helps?
Yeah really helps combat germs
i'll take my chances
yeah, but it is expensive to buy them
Yes, these are sanitizing wipes.
maybe, but I think the store should be responsible for clean carts
I always keep these wipes with me.
Yeah but they did not help because i still got sick
