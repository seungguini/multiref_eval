Ugh, I'd hate that.
Well what does that mean about our plans.
That's sucks.  You'll miss the game.
Do you get paid more?
Well, I guess you will have a good check.
Oh, I'm sorry.
We don't see you anymore.
You're a workaholic.
That sucks.
At least you're making money.
You need to relax.
More hours means more money.
You can save up for your car.
You can use the extra money.
