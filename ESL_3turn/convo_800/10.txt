That's kind of obvious.
Have there been a lot of car break-ins lately?
I wouldn't have expected any problems in this neighborhood.
That's good advice.
Has crime been bad around here lately?
I had my computer stolen once that way.
I'll be sure to do that and double check that my doors are locked.
Even in this neighborhood?
