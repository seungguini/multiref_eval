Have there been breakins?
That's kind of obvious.
Have there been a lot of car break-ins lately?
I wouldn't have expected any problems in this neighborhood.
Did someone break into a car?
I'll be sure to do that and double check that my doors are locked.
Even in this neighborhood?
Who would do that question mark
