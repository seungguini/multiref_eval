Have there been breakins?
That's kind of obvious.
Have there been a lot of car break-ins lately?
Has crime been bad around here lately?
Wow, that's kind of scary.
I had my computer stolen once that way.
Even in this neighborhood?
I don't think I have anything of value in my car ever that someone would want to take.
