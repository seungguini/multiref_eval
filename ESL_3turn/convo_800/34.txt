Have there been breakins?
What's going on?
I wouldn't have expected any problems in this neighborhood.
That's good advice.
Has crime been bad around here lately?
I had my computer stolen once that way.
I'll be sure to do that and double check that my doors are locked.
I don't think I have anything of value in my car ever that someone would want to take.
