I grew up speaking two languages in my household.
I learned to do that.
It's not like you can't learn to speak another language.
Languages have always come easy to me, unlike other subjects.
I'm jealous of people who can speak five languages.
Yeah, it has its benefits.
It wasn't that difficult.
I had fun learning how.
