I grew up speaking two languages in my household.
I learned to do that.
You already know English. I'm pretty sure you can learn Spanish very easily.
It's not like you can't learn to speak another language.
Yeah, it has its benefits.
It took a lot of work.
It wasn't that difficult.
I had fun learning how.
