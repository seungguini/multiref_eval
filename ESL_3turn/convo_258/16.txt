I grew up speaking two languages in my household.
I learned to do that.
It's not like you can't learn to speak another language.
Languages have always come easy to me, unlike other subjects.
It was very hard to learn.
I'm jealous of people who can speak five languages.
It took a lot of work.
I had fun learning how.
