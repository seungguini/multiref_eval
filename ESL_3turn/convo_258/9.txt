I grew up speaking two languages in my household.
You already know English. I'm pretty sure you can learn Spanish very easily.
Languages have always come easy to me, unlike other subjects.
I'm jealous of people who can speak five languages.
Yeah, it has its benefits.
It took a lot of work.
It wasn't that difficult.
I had fun learning how.
