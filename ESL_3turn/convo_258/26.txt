I grew up speaking two languages in my household.
I learned to do that.
You already know English. I'm pretty sure you can learn Spanish very easily.
Languages have always come easy to me, unlike other subjects.
It was very hard to learn.
I'm jealous of people who can speak five languages.
Yeah, it has its benefits.
It wasn't that difficult.
