I grew up speaking two languages in my household.
You already know English. I'm pretty sure you can learn Spanish very easily.
It's not like you can't learn to speak another language.
It was very hard to learn.
I'm jealous of people who can speak five languages.
Yeah, it has its benefits.
It took a lot of work.
It wasn't that difficult.
