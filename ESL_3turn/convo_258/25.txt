I grew up speaking two languages in my household.
I learned to do that.
You already know English. I'm pretty sure you can learn Spanish very easily.
I'm jealous of people who can speak five languages.
Yeah, it has its benefits.
It took a lot of work.
It wasn't that difficult.
I had fun learning how.
