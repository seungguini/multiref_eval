I grew up speaking two languages in my household.
You already know English. I'm pretty sure you can learn Spanish very easily.
It's not like you can't learn to speak another language.
Languages have always come easy to me, unlike other subjects.
Yeah, it has its benefits.
It took a lot of work.
It wasn't that difficult.
I had fun learning how.
