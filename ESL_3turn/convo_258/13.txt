I grew up speaking two languages in my household.
I learned to do that.
You already know English. I'm pretty sure you can learn Spanish very easily.
It's not like you can't learn to speak another language.
I'm jealous of people who can speak five languages.
Yeah, it has its benefits.
It took a lot of work.
It wasn't that difficult.
