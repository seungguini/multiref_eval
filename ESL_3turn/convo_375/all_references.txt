It's getting worse and worse.
I've had worse days, too.
I get there early.
Did you ever find anywhere to park?
It didn't use to be this bad.
It's better just to walk.
Come earlier.
A half an hour?
I find it very frustrating.
That's crazy!
Usually I can find something if I just keep looking.
I would rather just take the bus to school!
It's taking me longer than that on some days.
That's why I always have my mom drop me off instead of driving.
