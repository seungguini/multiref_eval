I don't know if I feel like Italian.
I'm always excited for Italian food!
Are you asking me out?
What is the price range of an entree there?
I was thinking Mexican food sounded good.
Do they have anything besides pasta?
Do you want to go there tonight?
Is it Northern or Southern Italian Cuisine?
That sounds great.
What is the name of it?
Where is this new place?
