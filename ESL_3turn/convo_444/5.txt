I haven't gotten my paycheck yet.
There was a mistake at my bank but it's been resolved.
I have fees I haven't paid.
I called to try to get an extension, but I've already had 3.
No, I never pay my phone bill and this is the first time this has happened!
I lost my job.
I haven't been able to make payments.
