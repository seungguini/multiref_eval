It is really close to the shoppiing mall and park isn't it?
Like what? The nearby park?
I can walk to everything.
I am glad you think it will be a good fit for you.
Yes, that's a beautiful park where I can go hiking and take my dog.
I don't have to drive as much.
I can bike more.
The air is so fresh.
