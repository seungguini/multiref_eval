It is really close to the shoppiing mall and park isn't it?
You are right! My favorite restaurant is right around the corner!
Like what? The nearby park?
I can walk to everything.
Yes, that's a beautiful park where I can go hiking and take my dog.
I can bike more.
The air is so fresh.
It's close to the ocean.
