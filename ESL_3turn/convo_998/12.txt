It is really close to the shoppiing mall and park isn't it?
You are right! My favorite restaurant is right around the corner!
Like what? The nearby park?
I can walk to everything.
I am glad you think it will be a good fit for you.
I can't wait to see the new place and explore together!
I don't have to drive as much.
The air is so fresh.
