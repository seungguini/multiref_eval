I guess I should pay more attention.
I didn't know that, how often should I check them?
Show me where they are.
That makes sense.
I'll check them when I get back.
Will you help me figure out how to check them?
Glad to hear that. I was worried about not having one.
That makes sense, I'll have to see where they are at.
