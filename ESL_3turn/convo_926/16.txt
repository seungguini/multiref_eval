How am I being stereotypical?
No, I am just a die hard fan of Hilary.
No I"m not. I just can't believe someone with so little experience beat someone with lots of experience.
Not really.
Am I? Did you predict Obama would win?
Just answer the question.
I'm just surprised that's all. I voted for him, but I didn't think he would win.
Is that a deflection?
