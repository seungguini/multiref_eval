No I"m not. I just can't believe someone with so little experience beat someone with lots of experience.
Yeah I guess I am.
Am I? Did you predict Obama would win?
No, I just thought everyone would vote for her. I'm glad Obama won.

I'm just surprised that's all. I voted for him, but I didn't think he would win.
Then why can't you believe it?
Is that a deflection?
