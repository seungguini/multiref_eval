No, I am just a die hard fan of Hilary.
No I"m not. I just can't believe someone with so little experience beat someone with lots of experience.

No, I just thought everyone would vote for her. I'm glad Obama won.
Just answer the question.
I'm just surprised that's all. I voted for him, but I didn't think he would win.
Is that a deflection?
