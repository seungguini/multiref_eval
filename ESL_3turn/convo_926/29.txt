Well that's what you really mean isn't it?
No I"m not. I just can't believe someone with so little experience beat someone with lots of experience.
Not really.
Am I? Did you predict Obama would win?
No, I just thought everyone would vote for her. I'm glad Obama won.
Just answer the question.
I figured more people would vote for her because of the 'Clinton' name. Obama was not well known at all.
Is that a deflection?
