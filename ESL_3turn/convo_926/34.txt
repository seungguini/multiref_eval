Well that's what you really mean isn't it?
No, I am just a die hard fan of Hilary.
No I"m not. I just can't believe someone with so little experience beat someone with lots of experience.
Yeah I guess I am.
Am I? Did you predict Obama would win?
Just answer the question.
I'm just surprised that's all. I voted for him, but I didn't think he would win.
Is that a deflection?
