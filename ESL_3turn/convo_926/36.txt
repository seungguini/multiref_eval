Well that's what you really mean isn't it?
How am I being stereotypical?
No, I am just a die hard fan of Hilary.
Yeah I guess I am.
No, I just thought everyone would vote for her. I'm glad Obama won.

I'm just surprised that's all. I voted for him, but I didn't think he would win.
I figured more people would vote for her because of the 'Clinton' name. Obama was not well known at all.
