Well that's what you really mean isn't it?
No, I am just a die hard fan of Hilary.
No I"m not. I just can't believe someone with so little experience beat someone with lots of experience.

Then why can't you believe it?
I figured more people would vote for her because of the 'Clinton' name. Obama was not well known at all.
