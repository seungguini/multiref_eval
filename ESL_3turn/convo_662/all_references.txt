I was always better at English.
That is an overstatement.
I know more than that!
No, it's not very good.
I've never liked math actually.
It wasn't my strongest subject.
I was just kidding.
I know most basic math.
Nope.
I'm actually pretty good at math.
I might know more than you.
I suck at math
I'm just joking, yes I am very good at math. How can I help you?
I only know the basics.
Well, I know most of my additions table.
