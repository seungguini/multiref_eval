I know it; I hate it.
It gives me a stomach ache.
I know!
Well, what are you gonna do, hope everyone leaves L.A.?
Lets go a different way.
It takes me 3 hours to get home.
I hate traffic!
You got a helicopter we can take instead?
This city is just not big enough anymore.
It's been horrible lately.
Overpopulation will be the end of us.
Lets move to the country.
We're going to be late.
Come on, apocalypse.
Lets start riding bikes everywhere.
This is so frustrating.
We've gotta figure out some other way to get around.
