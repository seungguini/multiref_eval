I just don't understand it.
Because my teacher is unfair.
The teacher isn't good at explaining things.
I don't like science.
Because the teacher isn't grading my papers fairly!
I get nervous when I do the tests, and get bad scores.
Because the teacher singles me out.
I've always struggled in science.
