Because he had nothing better to do.
He has a lot of time on his hands
I guess just to see if he could.
His kids drove him nuts and he needed to get away.
He is crazy!
I'm guessing that maybe he's crazy?
Maybe he wanted to get into the Guinness Book of World Records.
I bet someone dared him that he couldn't do it and he wanted to prove them wrong!
