He has a lot of time on his hands
Probably to challenge himself?
His kids drove him nuts and he needed to get away.

Who knows because I would never do that!
Maybe he wanted to get into the Guinness Book of World Records.
I bet someone dared him that he couldn't do it and he wanted to prove them wrong!
