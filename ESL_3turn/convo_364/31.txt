Worried about what?
You don't have to be worried.
I told you, I'm fine, there's nothing to worry about.
I'm sorry that you are worried, try and relax now that I'm here.
I'm fine, that's why I haven't been coming.
That doesn't give you any excuse to order me around.
I don't understand what you're worried about.
Yeah, you're always worried.
