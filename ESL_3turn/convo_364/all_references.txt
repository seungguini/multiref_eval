What are you worried about?
Worried about what?

I told you, I'm fine, there's nothing to worry about.

That doesn't give you any excuse to order me around.
I don't understand what you're worried about.
Yeah, you're always worried.
You're worrying for no reason.
About what?
About what?
Well so am I.
