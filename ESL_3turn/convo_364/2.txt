What are you worried about?
You don't have to be worried.
I told you, I'm fine, there's nothing to worry about.
I'm sorry that you are worried, try and relax now that I'm here.
I'm fine, that's why I haven't been coming.
You worry too much.
I don't understand what you're worried about.
Well so am I.
