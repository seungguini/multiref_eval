What are you worried about?
Worried about what?
You don't have to be worried.
I told you, I'm fine, there's nothing to worry about.
I'm sorry that you are worried, try and relax now that I'm here.
You worry too much.
That doesn't give you any excuse to order me around.
I don't understand what you're worried about.
