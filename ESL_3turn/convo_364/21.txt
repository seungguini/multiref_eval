Worried about what?
I told you, I'm fine, there's nothing to worry about.
I'm sorry that you are worried, try and relax now that I'm here.
That doesn't give you any excuse to order me around.
I don't understand what you're worried about.
Yeah, you're always worried.
You're worrying for no reason.
Well so am I.
