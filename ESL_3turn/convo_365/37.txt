Probably because he's a good liar.
They don't have enough to put him away longer.
I'm not sure, maybe they didn't have evidence to charge him
He paid the bond and got out.
Who knows why they do anything.
Every time was ruled to be a false accusation.
I hope they keep him in there now.
Now look what happened.
