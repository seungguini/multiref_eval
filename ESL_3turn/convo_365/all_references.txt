Probably because he's a good liar.
They don't have enough to put him away longer.
I guess he had a good lawyer.
His father owns the prison.
I'm not sure, maybe they didn't have evidence to charge him
He paid the bond and got out.
Who knows why they do anything.
Every time was ruled to be a false accusation.
It is hard to understand.
Good behavior.
I hope they keep him in there now.
Unreliable witness testimonies.
Now look what happened.
He has a great lawyer.
