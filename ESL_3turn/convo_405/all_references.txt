Sure I'm happy to assist you.
Hand it to me.
Lets go to the ATM and I will show you.
I can help you.
It's really easy, I'll show you.
You should be careful with your security.
Did you ask the bank?
It's very easy.
Did the card come with instructions or customer service information?
The hardest thing is not to forget it.
Me too, I do not have one.
Just don't leave it in the machine.
My dad could show you what to do.
Do you have a pin number?
