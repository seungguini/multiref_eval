I am just being honest.
She was awful.
I wasn't being mean, I was just stating a fact.
I am not being mean, she was terrible.
Sorry, but I'm paying a lot for this meal and demand good service.
I'm positive she spit in my food.
Oh well, you tip her then.
The food was good but its hard to enjoy when the customer service is bad.
