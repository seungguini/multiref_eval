I am just being honest.
Would it be nicer to lie?
I am not being mean, she was terrible.
Sorry, but I'm paying a lot for this meal and demand good service.
I'm positive she spit in my food.
I just think she doesn't deserve a large tip.
Oh well, you tip her then.
The food was good but its hard to enjoy when the customer service is bad.
