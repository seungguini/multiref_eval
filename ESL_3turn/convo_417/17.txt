She was awful.
Would it be nicer to lie?
I wasn't being mean, I was just stating a fact.
I am not being mean, she was terrible.
Sorry, but I'm paying a lot for this meal and demand good service.
I just think she doesn't deserve a large tip.
Oh well, you tip her then.
The food was good but its hard to enjoy when the customer service is bad.
