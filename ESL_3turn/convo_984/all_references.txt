Oh my gosh I fell asleep!
thank you!
Dang it, I'm sorry, I fell asleep!
OK I'm getting up.
What?
Which is the last stop?
Can I just stay onboard until after you turn the bus around?
I missed my stop.
I was supposed to get off at the second stop!
Can you please tell me which stop this is.
I can't believe that I fell asleep!
My goodness I slept through the entire ride.
I didn't sleep at all last night and I'm so tired.
Oh goodness.
