Oh my. Have you called them yet?
Oh, wow.  What happened?
You better be careful.
Oh no! You need to hire someone to fix it up.
Why haven't you called maintenance?
Will the landlord replace it for you?
How come it hasn't been repaired?
You should report it to your landlord. They might cover the repair expenses.
