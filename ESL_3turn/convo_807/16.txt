Oh, wow.  What happened?
You better be careful.
Why haven't you called maintenance?
Will the landlord replace it for you?
How did it get damaged so bad?
How long has it been like that?
You should report it to your landlord. They might cover the repair expenses.
Why don't you have them take care of it?
