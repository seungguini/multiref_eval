Oh my. Have you called them yet?
Oh, wow.  What happened?
Oh no! You need to hire someone to fix it up.
Why haven't you called maintenance?
They need to fix that for you.
How did it get damaged so bad?
You should report it to your landlord. They might cover the repair expenses.
Have you talked to your landlord?
