Oh my. Have you called them yet?
Why haven't you called maintenance?
Will the landlord replace it for you?
How did it get damaged so bad?
How long has it been like that?
How come it hasn't been repaired?
You should report it to your landlord. They might cover the repair expenses.
Have you talked to your landlord?
