Oh my. Have you called them yet?
Will the landlord replace it for you?
They need to fix that for you.
How did it get damaged so bad?
How long has it been like that?
You should report it to your landlord. They might cover the repair expenses.
Why don't you have them take care of it?
Have you talked to your landlord?
