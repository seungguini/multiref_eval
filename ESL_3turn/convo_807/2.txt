Oh my. Have you called them yet?
Oh no! You need to hire someone to fix it up.
Why haven't you called maintenance?
They need to fix that for you.
How did it get damaged so bad?
You should report it to your landlord. They might cover the repair expenses.
Why don't you have them take care of it?
Have you talked to your landlord?
