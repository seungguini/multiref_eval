I had a great time too, would you like to go out again.
No, thank you!
Thank you for joining me. I had a great time as well.
How sweet! We should go out together again sometime soon.
We could do it again next Friday!
Will I see you again.
Oh, be quiet!
I'm so glad you called. I can't stop thinking about you.
