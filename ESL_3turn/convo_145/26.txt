I had a great time too, would you like to go out again.
Thank you for joining me. I had a great time as well.
That's really sweet!
How sweet! We should go out together again sometime soon.
Let's do it again. How about next Friday?
You are welcome.
Will I see you again.
I'm so glad you called. I can't stop thinking about you.
