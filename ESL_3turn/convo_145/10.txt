That's so sweet! I had a fantastic time as well.
I'm glad you did, I was curious.
How sweet! We should go out together again sometime soon.
Let's do it again. How about next Friday?
We could do it again next Friday!
You are welcome.
Will I see you again.
I'm so glad you called. I can't stop thinking about you.
