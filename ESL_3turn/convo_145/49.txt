I had a great time too, would you like to go out again.
No, thank you!
That's so sweet! I had a fantastic time as well.
How sweet! We should go out together again sometime soon.
We could do it again next Friday!
You are welcome.
Oh, be quiet!
I'm so glad you called. I can't stop thinking about you.
