That's so sweet! I had a fantastic time as well.
I'm glad you did, I was curious.
That's really sweet!
How sweet! We should go out together again sometime soon.
Let's do it again. How about next Friday?
You are welcome.
I should be thanking you!
I'm so glad you called. I can't stop thinking about you.
