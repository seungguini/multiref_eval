I had a great time too, would you like to go out again.
That's so sweet! I had a fantastic time as well.
I'm glad you did, I was curious.
That's really sweet!
How sweet! We should go out together again sometime soon.
We could do it again next Friday!
You are welcome.
I'm so glad you called. I can't stop thinking about you.
