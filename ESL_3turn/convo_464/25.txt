Wow it's really hot this time of year.
I have family in Arizona.  Maybe we could carpool?
That's a long drive.
I've been there, it's an amazing state.
To visit your brother?
I heard it's a dry heat in Arizona.
I can't believe David would want to do that.
I've been to Arizona before and it's gorgeous!
