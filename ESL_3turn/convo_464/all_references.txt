Wow it's really hot this time of year.
I have family in Arizona.  Maybe we could carpool?
That sounds like fun.
Where in Arizona are you going?
I've never been there.
That's a long drive.
I've been there, it's an amazing state.
What made you choose Arizona?
To visit your brother?
I heard it's a dry heat in Arizona.
I can't believe David would want to do that.
I've been to Arizona before and it's gorgeous!
You'll never do that.
