Like the numbers on the clock.
Imagine a clock face, that 10 and 2.
Right there and right there.
Imagine your steering wheel as a clock
You've never heard that expression before?
Look at what my hands are doing.
It's just a way to remember where to put your hands, where the 10 and 2 are on a clock.
Like this.
