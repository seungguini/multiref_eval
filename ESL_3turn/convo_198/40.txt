Imagine a clock face, that 10 and 2.
Here let me show you.
Think of a clock face and put your hands where the 10 and 2 are.
You've never heard that expression before?
Look at what my hands are doing.
It's just a way to remember where to put your hands, where the 10 and 2 are on a clock.
Here, I'll show you.
You put one hand there and the other hand there.
