Like the numbers on the clock.
Imagine a clock face, that 10 and 2.
Imagine your steering wheel as a clock
Think of a clock face and put your hands where the 10 and 2 are.
You've never heard that expression before?
It's just a way to remember where to put your hands, where the 10 and 2 are on a clock.
Like this.
You put one hand there and the other hand there.
