Like the numbers on the clock.
Right there and right there.
Imagine your steering wheel as a clock
Think of a clock face and put your hands where the 10 and 2 are.
You've never heard that expression before?
Look at what my hands are doing.
Here, I'll show you.
You put one hand there and the other hand there.
