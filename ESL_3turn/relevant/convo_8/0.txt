Well, maybe they should lower the drinking age to 18?
You've got a great point.
Doesn't mean they shouldn't be able to vote.
That is true, but drinking and voting are two completely different things.
I think if a person can die for our country at 18, he/she ought to have the right to vote.
I'm pretty sure some of them have already taken their first sip.
I think it's better for people to be able to exercise their voice earlier.
That doesn't mean someone under 21 isn't responsible. They can still vote.
