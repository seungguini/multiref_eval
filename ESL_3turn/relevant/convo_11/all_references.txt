I'm just not a science person.
I just don't get science.
An A- is not low, mom!
I don't think a B is low.
The teacher is really terrible.
They are not that bad.
I have an assignment I still need to turn in.
The teacher has it out for me.
I don't think a B is low.
I'm trying to do better.
I hate science.
Science just comes hard for me.
Science is just not my thing.
Why are you being so hurtful?
I was docked for cheating.
It was one bad test.
You could be a little more encouraging, you know.
I messed up on the final test. I still passed though.
