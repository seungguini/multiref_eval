Try googling public transportation near me.
You have a few options.  You can take the bus, metro, or train.
I could still point you in the right direction.
Where are you trying to get to?
Maybe I can still help. What do you want to know?
You can call them to find out.
It has been so long and I'm not sure if I can help.
There is an information booth at the bus station.
