Some people prefer taxi cabs if they don't like crowds.
I could still point you in the right direction.
You can check online, the schedule changes depending on the day of the week
Where are you trying to get to?
Maybe I can still help. What do you want to know?
It has been so long and I'm not sure if I can help.
There is an information booth at the bus station.
