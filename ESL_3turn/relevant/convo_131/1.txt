Well the most frequently used is the city busline that goes all around the city.
Try googling public transportation near me.
The public transportation department offers that information on their website
I could still point you in the right direction.
Where are you trying to get to?
You can call them to find out.
It has been so long and I'm not sure if I can help.
There is an information booth at the bus station.
