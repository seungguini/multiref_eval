Well the most frequently used is the city busline that goes all around the city.
Try googling public transportation near me.
You have a few options.  You can take the bus, metro, or train.
Some people prefer taxi cabs if they don't like crowds.
I could still point you in the right direction.
You can check online, the schedule changes depending on the day of the week
Where are you trying to get to?
There is an information booth at the bus station.
