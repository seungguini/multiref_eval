Just wait for the next bus to come.
Yes the next street is Gage Avenue.
You can catch the next bus.
That's really unlucky, there are no more buses.
Gage is just one block over.
Just walk a few blocks and you'll be there.
I'm just kidding, it's Gage Avenue.
Don't worry, Gage Avenue is actually really close by.
