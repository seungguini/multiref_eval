Just wait for the next bus to come.
Yes the next street is Gage Avenue.
That's really unlucky, there are no more buses.
Gage is just one block over.
I can help you get there.
Just walk a few blocks and you'll be there.
You should have ask the bus driver.
Don't worry, Gage Avenue is actually really close by.
