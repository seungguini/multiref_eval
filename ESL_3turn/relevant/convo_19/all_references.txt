Just wait for the next bus to come.
Yes the next street is Gage Avenue.
You can catch the next bus.
That's okay, it's just one block away.
That's really unlucky, there are no more buses.
That's OK, it's just one block over.
Gage is just one block over.
I can help you get there.
Just walk a few blocks and you'll be there.
I don't know where Gage is.
I'm just kidding, it's Gage Avenue.
You should have ask the bus driver.
Don't worry, Gage Avenue is actually really close by.
I do that all the time.
