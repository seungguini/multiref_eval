Just wait for the next bus to come.
That's OK, it's just one block over.
Gage is just one block over.
Just walk a few blocks and you'll be there.
I don't know where Gage is.
I'm just kidding, it's Gage Avenue.
You should have ask the bus driver.
Don't worry, Gage Avenue is actually really close by.
