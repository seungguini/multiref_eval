Yes the next street is Gage Avenue.
You can catch the next bus.
That's okay, it's just one block away.
That's really unlucky, there are no more buses.
That's OK, it's just one block over.
I'm just kidding, it's Gage Avenue.
Don't worry, Gage Avenue is actually really close by.
I do that all the time.
