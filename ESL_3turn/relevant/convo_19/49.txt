Yes the next street is Gage Avenue.
You can catch the next bus.
That's okay, it's just one block away.
That's really unlucky, there are no more buses.
Gage is just one block over.
Just walk a few blocks and you'll be there.
You should have ask the bus driver.
Don't worry, Gage Avenue is actually really close by.
