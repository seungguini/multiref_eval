That's very kind, I appreciate the consideration.
I really don't like going to the theater.
What if I don't want to see some local theater production, is there anything else I can do?
Is there a museum nearby? I'd rather do that.
I see, is that the only scheduled event for this evening?
Maybe the hotel can find something better than the theater for me.
That's a bummer, I was looking forward to this.
If the tour is cancelled I think I'll make my own plans.
