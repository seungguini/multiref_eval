That sounds great! I never thought of that.
At least that's something.
What if I don't want to see some local theater production, is there anything else I can do?
Is there a museum nearby? I'd rather do that.
How bad can the weather be?
I see, is that the only scheduled event for this evening?
I think I just might want to take a nap
That's a bummer, I was looking forward to this.
