Thank you.
That sounds great! I never thought of that.
At least that's something.
I really don't like going to the theater.
Is there a museum nearby? I'd rather do that.
I see, is that the only scheduled event for this evening?
I was really looking forward to the tour, will it be rescheduled?
If the tour is cancelled I think I'll make my own plans.
