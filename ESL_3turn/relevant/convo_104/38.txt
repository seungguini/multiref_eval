Thank you.
That sounds like fun.
That's very kind, I appreciate the consideration.
At least that's something.
How bad can the weather be?
I think I just might want to take a nap
Maybe the hotel can find something better than the theater for me.
I was really looking forward to the tour, will it be rescheduled?
