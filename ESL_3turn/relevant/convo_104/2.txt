That's very kind, I appreciate the consideration.
That sounds great! I never thought of that.
At least that's something.
Is there a museum nearby? I'd rather do that.
How bad can the weather be?
I was really looking forward to the tour, will it be rescheduled?
That's a bummer, I was looking forward to this.
If the tour is cancelled I think I'll make my own plans.
