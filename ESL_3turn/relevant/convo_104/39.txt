Thank you.
That sounds like fun.
At least that's something.
I really don't like going to the theater.
What if I don't want to see some local theater production, is there anything else I can do?
I see, is that the only scheduled event for this evening?
Maybe the hotel can find something better than the theater for me.
That's a bummer, I was looking forward to this.
