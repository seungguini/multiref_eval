Thank you.
That sounds great! I never thought of that.
At least that's something.
I really don't like going to the theater.
Is there a museum nearby? I'd rather do that.
How bad can the weather be?
Maybe the hotel can find something better than the theater for me.
That's a bummer, I was looking forward to this.
