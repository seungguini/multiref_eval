Thank you.
That sounds like fun.
That's very kind, I appreciate the consideration.
What if I don't want to see some local theater production, is there anything else I can do?
How bad can the weather be?
I think I just might want to take a nap
Maybe the hotel can find something better than the theater for me.
That's a bummer, I was looking forward to this.
