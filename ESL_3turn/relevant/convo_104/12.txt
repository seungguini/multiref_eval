That sounds like fun.
That's very kind, I appreciate the consideration.
I really don't like going to the theater.
How bad can the weather be?
I think I just might want to take a nap
Maybe the hotel can find something better than the theater for me.
That's a bummer, I was looking forward to this.
If the tour is cancelled I think I'll make my own plans.
