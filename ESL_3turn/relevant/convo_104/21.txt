That's very kind, I appreciate the consideration.
That sounds great! I never thought of that.
At least that's something.
I really don't like going to the theater.
How bad can the weather be?
I see, is that the only scheduled event for this evening?
Maybe the hotel can find something better than the theater for me.
I was really looking forward to the tour, will it be rescheduled?
