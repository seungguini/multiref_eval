That's very kind, I appreciate the consideration.
That sounds great! I never thought of that.
At least that's something.
Is there a museum nearby? I'd rather do that.
I see, is that the only scheduled event for this evening?
I think I just might want to take a nap
Maybe the hotel can find something better than the theater for me.
I was really looking forward to the tour, will it be rescheduled?
