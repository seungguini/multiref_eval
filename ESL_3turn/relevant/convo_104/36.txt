Thank you.
That's very kind, I appreciate the consideration.
That sounds great! I never thought of that.
I really don't like going to the theater.
What if I don't want to see some local theater production, is there anything else I can do?
How bad can the weather be?
Maybe the hotel can find something better than the theater for me.
I was really looking forward to the tour, will it be rescheduled?
