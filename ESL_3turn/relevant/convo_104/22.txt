Thank you.
That sounds like fun.
That's very kind, I appreciate the consideration.
At least that's something.
How bad can the weather be?
I see, is that the only scheduled event for this evening?
I was really looking forward to the tour, will it be rescheduled?
That's a bummer, I was looking forward to this.
