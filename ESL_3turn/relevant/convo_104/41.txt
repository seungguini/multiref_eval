Thank you.
That sounds like fun.
That's very kind, I appreciate the consideration.
Is there a museum nearby? I'd rather do that.
I see, is that the only scheduled event for this evening?
Maybe the hotel can find something better than the theater for me.
I was really looking forward to the tour, will it be rescheduled?
If the tour is cancelled I think I'll make my own plans.
