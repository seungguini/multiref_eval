Thank you.
That sounds like fun.
That's very kind, I appreciate the consideration.
At least that's something.
What if I don't want to see some local theater production, is there anything else I can do?
I see, is that the only scheduled event for this evening?
I think I just might want to take a nap
I was really looking forward to the tour, will it be rescheduled?
