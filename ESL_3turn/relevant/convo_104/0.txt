That's very kind, I appreciate the consideration.
At least that's something.
I really don't like going to the theater.
Is there a museum nearby? I'd rather do that.
How bad can the weather be?
I see, is that the only scheduled event for this evening?
I was really looking forward to the tour, will it be rescheduled?
That's a bummer, I was looking forward to this.
