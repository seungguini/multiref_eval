Thank you.
That sounds great! I never thought of that.
At least that's something.
I really don't like going to the theater.
How bad can the weather be?
Maybe the hotel can find something better than the theater for me.
I was really looking forward to the tour, will it be rescheduled?
If the tour is cancelled I think I'll make my own plans.
