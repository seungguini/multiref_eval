Where do you want me to start.
Nope that's ok!
No thank you .
I'd rather not, to be honest.
I'll do anything but the dirty dishes.
OK what do you want me to do?
Of course I'll help!
If you ask me to, I will gladly help!
Do we have to clean it right now?
What do you want me to do?
Ugh I hate cleaning!
What can I do to help?
I've got to go to work.
Sure thing sweetie!
