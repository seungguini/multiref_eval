If you lost some weight you might feel differently!
Maybe you should try changing your sleeping position.
Why do you think it's uncomfortable?
it's great to me.
Personally, I don't mind it!
We've had it for forever and you've never said anything about it being uncomfortable!
is it too soft?
I think it is?
