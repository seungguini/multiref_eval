We need to go and look for a new one then.
Well it is pretty old.
Why do you think it's uncomfortable?
it's great to me.
Personally, I don't mind it!
We've had it for forever and you've never said anything about it being uncomfortable!
is it too soft?
It's way better than the one in the guest bedroom.
