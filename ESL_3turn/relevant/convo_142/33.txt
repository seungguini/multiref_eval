I don't have any trouble sleeping on it.
Well it is pretty old.
If you lost some weight you might feel differently!
Maybe you should try changing your sleeping position.
Personally, I don't mind it!
We've had it for forever and you've never said anything about it being uncomfortable!
It's way better than the one in the guest bedroom.
What did you have in mind?
