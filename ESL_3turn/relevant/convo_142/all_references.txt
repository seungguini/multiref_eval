I don't have any trouble sleeping on it.
We need to go and look for a new one then.
Well it is pretty old.
If you lost some weight you might feel differently!
Maybe you should try changing your sleeping position.
Why do you think it's uncomfortable?
it's great to me.
Personally, I don't mind it!
We've had it for forever and you've never said anything about it being uncomfortable!
is it too soft?
I think it is?
Do you want to go shop?
It's way better than the one in the guest bedroom.
What did you have in mind?
