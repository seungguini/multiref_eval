I don't have any trouble sleeping on it.
We need to go and look for a new one then.

Maybe you should try changing your sleeping position.
Why do you think it's uncomfortable?
We've had it for forever and you've never said anything about it being uncomfortable!
I think it is?
What did you have in mind?
