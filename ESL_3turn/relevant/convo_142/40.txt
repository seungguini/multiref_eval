I don't have any trouble sleeping on it.
We need to go and look for a new one then.
Maybe you should try changing your sleeping position.
it's great to me.
Personally, I don't mind it!
We've had it for forever and you've never said anything about it being uncomfortable!
is it too soft?
Do you want to go shop?
