I don't have any trouble sleeping on it.
Well it is pretty old.
Maybe you should try changing your sleeping position.
it's great to me.
Personally, I don't mind it!
We've had it for forever and you've never said anything about it being uncomfortable!
It's way better than the one in the guest bedroom.
What did you have in mind?
