Oh no. I'm sorry.
What do you have?
I'm sorry to hear that.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear.
Are you getting a cold?
Oh no. Is there anything I can do for you?
What is wrong with you?
Yeah, a lot of people have been coming down with sicknesses lately.
I hope you feel better.
What is bothering you?
That's weird, so am I.
Hang in there.
In what way?
At least it's Friday.
Are you still feeling nauseous?
