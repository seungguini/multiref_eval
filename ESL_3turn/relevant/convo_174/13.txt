I let Alice borrow it for the weekend.
Alice will give it back to me once she's back from San Francisco.
We'll get you a car after you graduate.
I know
You have to get a part time job.
I promise I won't do it again.
Do you think that we didn't know that?
You won't be driving while you live my house, young man.
