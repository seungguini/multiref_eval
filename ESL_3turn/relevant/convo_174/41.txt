what does that have to do with it
Pay attention next time.
I know you've talked to me about not letting anyone borrow my car.
You have to get a part time job.
And who is to blame for that?
If you can make the half the money for a car, we'll pay the rest.
Do you think that we didn't know that?
You won't be driving while you live my house, young man.
