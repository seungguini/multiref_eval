what does that have to do with it
I let Alice borrow it for the weekend.
you may have one soon
We'll get you a car after you graduate.
Well you better start paying attention.
You have to get a part time job.
If you can make the half the money for a car, we'll pay the rest.
You won't be driving while you live my house, young man.
