Okay, I'll teach you.
Why are swim classes embarrassing?
Do you think they're going to put you with little kids?
I don't have the time, sorry.
Nobody's even paying attention.
How much are you willing to pay me?
They're embarrassing for everyone, so you'll be embarrassed together.
You need to get over yourself.
