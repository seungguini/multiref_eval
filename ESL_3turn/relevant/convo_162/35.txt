Lol of course you did.
You should start saving up for another iTunes card.
I've done that before!
Why don't you just get spotify?
I bet you're excited to listen to it!
Amazing how quickly you can go through the iTunes!
They're probably some of my favorite artists too.
There's more than just music on iTunes.
