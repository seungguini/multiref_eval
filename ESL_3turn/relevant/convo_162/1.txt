Lol of course you did.
I've done that before!
Why don't you just get spotify?
I bet you're excited to listen to it!
I'll have to come over so I can listen with you.
Amazing how quickly you can go through the iTunes!
They're probably some of my favorite artists too.
There's more than just music on iTunes.
