I don't mind the drive, it is a beautiful drive.
We can listen to music the whole trip.
We can split the drive and that will make it easier.
True, but it's very pretty along the highway.
The time will fly by.
Maybe we should go when we have more time.
That's not that far a drive.
That's still a one day drive, so I can drive the whole time if you want.
