I'll leave early and take lots of breaks.
We can listen to music the whole trip.
We can split the drive and that will make it easier.
True, but it's very pretty along the highway.
The time will fly by.
Maybe we should go when we have more time.
I know, but I really want to see Seattle.
That's still a one day drive, so I can drive the whole time if you want.
