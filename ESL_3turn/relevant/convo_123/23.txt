I don't mind the drive, it is a beautiful drive.
We can listen to music the whole trip.
We could go to Portland instead.
We can split the drive and that will make it easier.
True, but it's very pretty along the highway.
The time will fly by.
I know, but I really want to see Seattle.
That's still a one day drive, so I can drive the whole time if you want.
