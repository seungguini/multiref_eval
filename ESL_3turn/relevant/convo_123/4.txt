I'll leave early and take lots of breaks.
We can listen to music the whole trip.
We could go to Portland instead.
We can split the drive and that will make it easier.
The time will fly by.
Maybe we should go when we have more time.
That's not that far a drive.
That's still a one day drive, so I can drive the whole time if you want.
