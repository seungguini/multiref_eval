I don't mind the drive, it is a beautiful drive.
I'll leave early and take lots of breaks.
We can listen to music the whole trip.
We could go to Portland instead.
We can split the drive and that will make it easier.
True, but it's very pretty along the highway.
I know, but I really want to see Seattle.
That's not that far a drive.
