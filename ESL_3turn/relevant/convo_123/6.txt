I'll leave early and take lots of breaks.
We could go to Portland instead.
True, but it's very pretty along the highway.
The time will fly by.
Maybe we should go when we have more time.
I know, but I really want to see Seattle.
That's not that far a drive.
That's still a one day drive, so I can drive the whole time if you want.
