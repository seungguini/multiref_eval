Well, what kind of science classes do you like the most?
start with biology 101
You can substitute an english course actually
I'm registered for organic chemistry, if you'd like to be in the same class.
Science classes are the worst!
I heard Biology is fun.
Be careful not to take miss defey she's hard
There are great teachers in the science department, so you can't go wrong!
