OK, I'll keep that in mind,
Ok, how much shorter would you like it?
I wish you told me then. I would have been happy to fix it.
I'll cut it shorter this time.
This time we'll cut it shorter until you're happy with the length.
What did you have in mind?
You look great no matter what! Now that I know I'll make sure you're happy with your cut before you leave.
Of course. How short would you like it?
