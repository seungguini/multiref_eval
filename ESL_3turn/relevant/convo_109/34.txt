I agree!
I'm willing to pay more for my peace of mind.
Means I will work a second job but it will be worth it.
I didn't really want to go higher, but it's worth it.
I'm not happy about the price, is there a way we can work out a solution?
Did you see how many windows there are?
I love the neighborhood but it's completely out of my price range and I can't afford it.
I'm so excited to be moving there!
