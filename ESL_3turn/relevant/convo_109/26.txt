I agree!
It's looking better for sure.
I'm willing to pay more for my peace of mind.
Means I will work a second job but it will be worth it.
I'm not sure, I want to keep looking.
I didn't really want to go higher, but it's worth it.
I love the neighborhood but it's completely out of my price range and I can't afford it.
I'm so excited to be moving there!
