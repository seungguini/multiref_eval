How'd you manage that?
How did you do it?
That's terrible! How did that happen?
How did you break your leg?
Wow, way to be a klutz.
What happened?
Oh, no. Did you know the elevator is right over there?
What were you doing when the accident happened?
I'm sorry. If you'll just lean on me I can help you up the steps.
Are you still in pain?
Did you break it skiing?
Does the cast bother you?
Have you broke any bones before this?
