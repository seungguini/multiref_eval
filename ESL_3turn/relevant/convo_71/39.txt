That's terrible! How did that happen?
Wow, way to be a klutz.
Oh, no. Did you know the elevator is right over there?
What were you doing when the accident happened?
I'm sorry. If you'll just lean on me I can help you up the steps.
Are you still in pain?
Does the cast bother you?
Have you broke any bones before this?
