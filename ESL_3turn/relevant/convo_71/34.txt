How'd you manage that?
How did you do it?
How did you break your leg?
Wow, way to be a klutz.
Oh, no. Did you know the elevator is right over there?
What were you doing when the accident happened?
I'm sorry. If you'll just lean on me I can help you up the steps.
Have you broke any bones before this?
