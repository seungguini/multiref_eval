There is a wait of ten minutes.
Probably half an hour.  We are very busy tonight.
We'll have your table ready in just a moment.
We have four other customers ahead of you.
Half or hour or so.  You are welcome to sit at the bar.
I'll get you in as soon as possible!
It should only be one or two minutes.
We're very busy, so it could take up to an hour.
