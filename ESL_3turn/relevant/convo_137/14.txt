We are pretty booked, but it shouldn't be long.
It shouldn't be more than five minutes.
There is a wait of ten minutes.
Probably half an hour.  We are very busy tonight.
We'll have your table ready in just a moment.
We have four other customers ahead of you.
Half or hour or so.  You are welcome to sit at the bar.
We're very busy, so it could take up to an hour.
