We are pretty booked, but it shouldn't be long.
There is a wait of ten minutes.
Probably half an hour.  We are very busy tonight.
We'll have your table ready in just a moment.
Half or hour or so.  You are welcome to sit at the bar.
There is only one party ahead of you, so ten minutes.
It should only be a minute.
We are clearing a table right now.
