We are pretty booked, but it shouldn't be long.
It shouldn't be more than five minutes.
There is a wait of ten minutes.
The wait time tonight is only 10 minutes.
We'll have your table ready in just a moment.
I'll get you in as soon as possible!
There is only one party ahead of you, so ten minutes.
We are clearing a table right now.
