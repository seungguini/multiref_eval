We are pretty booked, but it shouldn't be long.
It shouldn't be more than five minutes.
There is a wait of ten minutes.
We have four other customers ahead of you.
Half or hour or so.  You are welcome to sit at the bar.
I'll get you in as soon as possible!
It should only be a minute.
We're very busy, so it could take up to an hour.
