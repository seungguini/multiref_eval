We are pretty booked, but it shouldn't be long.
There is a wait of ten minutes.
Probably half an hour.  We are very busy tonight.
The wait time tonight is only 10 minutes.
We'll have your table ready in just a moment.
We have four other customers ahead of you.
Half or hour or so.  You are welcome to sit at the bar.
It should only be one or two minutes.
