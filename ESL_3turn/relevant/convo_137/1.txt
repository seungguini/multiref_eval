We are pretty booked, but it shouldn't be long.
There is a wait of ten minutes.
We have four other customers ahead of you.
Half or hour or so.  You are welcome to sit at the bar.
I'll get you in as soon as possible!
There is only one party ahead of you, so ten minutes.
It should only be a minute.
We are clearing a table right now.
