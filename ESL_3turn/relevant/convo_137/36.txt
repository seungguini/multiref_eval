We are pretty booked, but it shouldn't be long.
It shouldn't be more than five minutes.
There is a wait of ten minutes.
The wait time tonight is only 10 minutes.
We have four other customers ahead of you.
I'll get you in as soon as possible!
We are clearing a table right now.
We're very busy, so it could take up to an hour.
