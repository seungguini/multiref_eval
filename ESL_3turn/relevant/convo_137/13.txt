Probably half an hour.  We are very busy tonight.
The wait time tonight is only 10 minutes.
We'll have your table ready in just a moment.
We have four other customers ahead of you.
I'll get you in as soon as possible!
There is only one party ahead of you, so ten minutes.
It should only be a minute.
We're very busy, so it could take up to an hour.
