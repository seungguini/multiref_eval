What is she like?
Seriously? Did you actually run into her?
Which street were you on when you two met?
Literally? Or figuratively?
What did you all say?
I would have loved to have heard that conversation!
That's a cool way to meet. Maybe you'll tell the story to your kids some day.
What kind of girl is she?
