I have always had bad things happen to me on Friday the thirteenth.
I've always found it to be good luck.
I've never believed in superstitions.
I hope I don't see any black cats.
Maybe I should change my mindset and think of it as a good day.
Maybe we should stay in to avoid any bad luck.
Just make sure you don't walk under any ladders.
How did it get the reputation of being unlucky?
