Take the bus from Maywood to the midpoint.
It's the gray line.
I'm not sure of the number, but it's the one from maywood to Corona.
Let's see the map.
It is the next one.
Take the bus that leaves at 4 p.m.
Show me the busstops and i'll help you.
I don't remember actually, just look at the route map.
