Take the bus from Maywood to the midpoint.
I'm not sure of the number, but it's the one from maywood to Corona.
Take the bus that leaves at 4 p.m.
Probably the one to fishburn.
Show me the busstops and i'll help you.
I'm sorry, I do not know.
I don't remember actually, just look at the route map.
I'm sorry, I don't work here.
