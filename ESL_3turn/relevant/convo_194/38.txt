You are going to take bus 29.
I'm not sure of the number, but it's the one from maywood to Corona.
It is the next one.
Take the bus that leaves at 4 p.m.
Probably the one to fishburn.
I'm sorry, I do not know.
I don't remember actually, just look at the route map.
If you wait around long enough I'm sure you'll find out.
