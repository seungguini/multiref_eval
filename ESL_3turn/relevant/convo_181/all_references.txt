Alright. You can pay this time.
That's nice of you, thanks.
OK feel free.
If you insist, but I'll pay next time.
No, it's fine. I've already got my card out.
No, I insist.
If you insist.
No it's fine, I don't mind paying again.
Please, let me do this.
Well thank you.  I appreciate it.
It's too expensive, let's split it.
Okay, you can pay.
That's so generous of you.
Are you sure?
