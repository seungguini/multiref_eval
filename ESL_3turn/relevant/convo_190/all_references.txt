Well maybe it's a fire pit out back, let's go see!
How do you know?
Call the fire department!
Oh my god, did you call the fire department?!
Have you called the fire department?
Have you called 911?
Has someone called the fire department?
Did you see anyone in the house?
We should go help them!
Is the fire department there yet?
I hope everyone is okay!
Let's get out of the street!
Did everyone get out ok?
Do you know CPR?
Did their dog get out?
