It's cold and white and soft!
It's very cold, and sometimes it's packable for making snowballs.
It can turn into a sheet of ice if you do not shovel it quickly.
It's beautiful to look at but awful to drive in.
It's wonderful.  Everything seems so peaceful and quiet whenever it snows.
It's cold, but fun to make a snowman with!
It is white.
It is cold.
