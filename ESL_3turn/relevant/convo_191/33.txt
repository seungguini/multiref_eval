It is very fluffy.
It is cold and yucky.
It's white and cold.
It's beautiful to look at but awful to drive in.
It's wonderful.  Everything seems so peaceful and quiet whenever it snows.
I'ts nice, kind of peaceful and pretty if the flakes are large
I'ts great, but gets old fast too.
It is fun to build a snowman with.
