Why not?
Have there been breakins?
Have there been a lot of car break-ins lately?
What's going on?
Wow, that's kind of scary.
I had my computer stolen once that way.
I'll be sure to do that and double check that my doors are locked.
I don't think I have anything of value in my car ever that someone would want to take.
