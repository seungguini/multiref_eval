Why not?
That's kind of obvious.
Did someone break into a car?
Wow, that's kind of scary.
I had my computer stolen once that way.
I'll be sure to do that and double check that my doors are locked.
Even in this neighborhood?
I don't think I have anything of value in my car ever that someone would want to take.
