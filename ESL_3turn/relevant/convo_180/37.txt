I wouldn't have expected any problems in this neighborhood.
Has crime been bad around here lately?
Did someone break into a car?
Wow, that's kind of scary.
I had my computer stolen once that way.
When did they start posting this?
I'll be sure to do that and double check that my doors are locked.
Who would do that question mark
