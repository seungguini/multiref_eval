That's kind of obvious.
What's going on?
Has crime been bad around here lately?
Did someone break into a car?
When did they start posting this?
I'll be sure to do that and double check that my doors are locked.
Even in this neighborhood?
I don't think I have anything of value in my car ever that someone would want to take.
