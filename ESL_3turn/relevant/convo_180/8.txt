Have there been breakins?
That's kind of obvious.
Has crime been bad around here lately?
Wow, that's kind of scary.
I had my computer stolen once that way.
I'll be sure to do that and double check that my doors are locked.
I don't think I have anything of value in my car ever that someone would want to take.
Who would do that question mark
