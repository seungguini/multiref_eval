Have there been a lot of car break-ins lately?
What's going on?
I wouldn't have expected any problems in this neighborhood.
That's good advice.
Did someone break into a car?
Wow, that's kind of scary.
I don't think I have anything of value in my car ever that someone would want to take.
Who would do that question mark
