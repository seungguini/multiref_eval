Sorry, ma'am, it's the law.
You should have bought a drink in the airport.
You sound like an alcoholic
do you want a pillow
Suck it up and fly
Rum and coke is disgusting in my opinion
I'm sorry you are uncomfortable, can I get you some pretzels?
There is a bag located in the compartment in front of you, for your convenience.
