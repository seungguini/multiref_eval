You should have bought a drink in the airport.
You sound like an alcoholic
Be patient and I will come right back when we reach the right altitude.
do you want a pillow
Suck it up and fly
Rum and coke is disgusting in my opinion
There is a bag located in the compartment in front of you, for your convenience.
That is not my problem
