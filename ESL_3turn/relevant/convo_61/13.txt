I suggest you focus on the experience rather than the material things.
I have no idea.
I use gift certificates for my husband.   That way he can get what he wants.
Get some lingerie to wear for him.
I'm a big believer in gift certificates.
Something homemade is best.
Give him a sexual coupon book.
I'm not good at these kind of suggestions.
