I have no idea.
I use gift certificates for my husband.   That way he can get what he wants.
Maybe plan a romantic getaway.
I'm a big believer in gift certificates.
He mentioned that he enjoys golfing.   Maybe you can buy some vouchers at his local golf course.
Buy him season passes to his favorite sports team.
Something homemade is best.
Give him a sexual coupon book.
