I suggest you focus on the experience rather than the material things.
Get some lingerie to wear for him.
Maybe plan a romantic getaway.
I'm a big believer in gift certificates.
Buy him season passes to his favorite sports team.
Take him to a sporting event.
Give him a sexual coupon book.
Depends what he likes to do.
