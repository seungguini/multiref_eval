I suggest you focus on the experience rather than the material things.
Get some lingerie to wear for him.
Maybe plan a romantic getaway.
I'm a big believer in gift certificates.
He mentioned that he enjoys golfing.   Maybe you can buy some vouchers at his local golf course.
Buy him season passes to his favorite sports team.
Take him to a sporting event.
I'm not good at these kind of suggestions.
