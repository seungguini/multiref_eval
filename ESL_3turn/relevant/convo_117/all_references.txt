Pfft. They say that a few times a week.
where are they going?
Well, that's rude.
They sound like weak minded parents
I wonder where they go.
how long do we have to babysit?
I guess they've been doing a lot for us lately.
I guess that is fair
But we never see them anymore!
Why are we always selected, cant they hire a babysitter
Dad is always gone on work trips.
Tell them that I already made plans
One day, we'll go on our own vacation without them!
should be fun if we order pizza
