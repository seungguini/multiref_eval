Well, that's rude.
They sound like weak minded parents
I wonder where they go.
I guess they've been doing a lot for us lately.
Why are we always selected, cant they hire a babysitter
Dad is always gone on work trips.
Tell them that I already made plans
One day, we'll go on our own vacation without them!
