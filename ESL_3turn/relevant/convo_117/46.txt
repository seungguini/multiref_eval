Pfft. They say that a few times a week.
I wonder where they go.
how long do we have to babysit?
I guess they've been doing a lot for us lately.
I guess that is fair
But we never see them anymore!
Why are we always selected, cant they hire a babysitter
One day, we'll go on our own vacation without them!
