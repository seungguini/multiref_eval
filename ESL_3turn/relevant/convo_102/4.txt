No, not at all.
Yes they did. They were good tenants.
Yes, they did.
The last tenant was great! I had no problems with them
I think the previous tenant did their best, there are a few damages that can be easily fixed.
They were a little messy but nothing ever broke.
The last tenant was actually a handy man so this place needed no work at all after he left.
He was one of the worst tenants I've ever had. He made no effort to maintain the apartment.
