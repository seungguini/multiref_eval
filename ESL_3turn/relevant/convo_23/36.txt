I can help you with that.
What seems to be trouble?
In what city are you looking for apartments in?
What type of apartment do you want to live in?
Have you visited the housing office.  They can help.
Are you looking for a studio apartment or are you living with roommates?
Do you lack motivation?
You should make a list of things to do.
