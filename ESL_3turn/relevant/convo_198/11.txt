We have burgers and we have apps.
Right now all we have is Pizza and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.
We have all sorts of things available to order.
If you'll provide me an email address I will send you a menu.
If you look at our menu in the desk, you'll be able to see our offerings.
Are you a vegetarian?
We are currently offering our soup of the day, which is clam chowder, or the chef's special which is filet mignon.
Breakfast until 11:00.
