There is a menu in your bedside table.
Read the menu and call back when you're ready.
We have all sorts of things available to order.
We have a wide range of foods, everything from chicken salad to oribeyes.
If you'll provide me an email address I will send you a menu.
If you look at our menu in the desk, you'll be able to see our offerings.
We are currently offering our soup of the day, which is clam chowder, or the chef's special which is filet mignon.
Breakfast until 11:00.
