Food.
Did you want breakfast or dinner?
Read the menu and call back when you're ready.
We have a wide range of foods, everything from chicken salad to oribeyes.
If you'll provide me an email address I will send you a menu.
We are currently offering our soup of the day, which is clam chowder, or the chef's special which is filet mignon.
We have a menu in the desk drawer there.
Breakfast until 11:00.
