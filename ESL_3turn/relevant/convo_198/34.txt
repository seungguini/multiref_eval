Did you want breakfast or dinner?
We have a wide range of foods, everything from chicken salad to oribeyes.
If you'll provide me an email address I will send you a menu.
If you look at our menu in the desk, you'll be able to see our offerings.
Are you a vegetarian?
We are currently offering our soup of the day, which is clam chowder, or the chef's special which is filet mignon.
We have a menu in the desk drawer there.
Breakfast until 11:00.
