Read the menu and call back when you're ready.
We have a wide range of foods, everything from chicken salad to oribeyes.

Are you a vegetarian?
We are currently offering our soup of the day, which is clam chowder, or the chef's special which is filet mignon.
We have a menu in the desk drawer there.
