do you think it helps?
Yeah really helps combat germs
Thanks, I thought of it.
I just saw a child licking this, so.
yeah, but it is expensive to buy them
You can pick up a travel pack of these wipes to keep in your purse.
I always keep these wipes with me.
Yeah but they did not help because i still got sick
