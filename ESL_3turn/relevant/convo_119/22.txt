Yes, shopping carts are breeding grounds for germs.
i'll take my chances
I just saw a child licking this, so.
yeah, but it is expensive to buy them
maybe, but I think the store should be responsible for clean carts
of course it is, I am a genius afterall
I always keep these wipes with me.
Yeah but they did not help because i still got sick
