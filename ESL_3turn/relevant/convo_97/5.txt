Instead of a present, give him tickets to something you can do together.
How about a book?
How about tickets to the game?
What does he like to do?
You should look on Pinterest for gift ideas.
Why dont you take him out to dinner?
Has your dad asked for anything?
I am sure your dad will appreciate anything you get him.
