Instead of a present, give him tickets to something you can do together.
You should look up some father's day gifts online.
What are his interests?
Why dont you take him out to dinner?
Has your dad asked for anything?
Is there anything that your father has been wanting?
I am sure your dad will appreciate anything you get him.
How about a gift certificate?
