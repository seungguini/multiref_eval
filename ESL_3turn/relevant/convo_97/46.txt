Instead of a present, give him tickets to something you can do together.
How about a book?
How about tickets to the game?
You should look on Pinterest for gift ideas.
Why dont you take him out to dinner?
Does he play golf?
I am sure your dad will appreciate anything you get him.
Does he like electronics?
