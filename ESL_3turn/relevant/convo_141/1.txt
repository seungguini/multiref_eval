I've also noticed the drop in quality.
The reduced quality makes the higher prices even harder to swallow.
I guess I'm going to have to stop buying it.
I think it is.
The tomatoes are out of season!
I love fruit and it makes me so sad that it's not good this year!
Why do you say that?
What do you mean?
