I've also noticed the drop in quality.
I noticed the same.
I feel like I'm getting ripped off.
The reduced quality makes the higher prices even harder to swallow.
The tomatoes are out of season!
I love fruit and it makes me so sad that it's not good this year!
It looks nice to me.
Why do you say that?
