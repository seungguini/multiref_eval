It's so frustrating!
I noticed the same.
I feel like I'm getting ripped off.
The reduced quality makes the higher prices even harder to swallow.
I guess I'm going to have to stop buying it.
The tomatoes are out of season!
I love fruit and it makes me so sad that it's not good this year!
It looks nice to me.
