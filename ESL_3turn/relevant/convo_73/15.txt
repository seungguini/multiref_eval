Man, I wish. Donald Trump won instead, now we're screwed.
Are you sure about that?
As long as Trump isn't president I'm fine.
Do you think that will change the course of history?
That's a good point.
What does that have to do with anything?
I'm just worried about the people in Congress.
I think she'll do a great job.
