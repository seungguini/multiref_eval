Are you sure about that?
As long as Trump isn't president I'm fine.
What does that have to do with anything?
I'm just worried about the people in Congress.
Are you voting for a women?
She can't be any worse than the guy that just left office.
Do you vote for someone based on things like that?
I think she'll do a great job.
