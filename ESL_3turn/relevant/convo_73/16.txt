Man, I wish. Donald Trump won instead, now we're screwed.
Are you sure about that?
As long as Trump isn't president I'm fine.
Do you think that will change the course of history?
That's a good point.
Are you voting for a women?
She can't be any worse than the guy that just left office.
I think she'll do a great job.
