Man, I wish. Donald Trump won instead, now we're screwed.
Are you sure about that?
As long as Trump isn't president I'm fine.
Do you think that will change the course of history?
What does that have to do with anything?
I'm just worried about the people in Congress.
Are you voting for a women?
Do you vote for someone based on things like that?
