Are you sure about that?
As long as Trump isn't president I'm fine.
Do you think that will change the course of history?
That's a good point.
I'm just worried about the people in Congress.
She can't be any worse than the guy that just left office.
Do you vote for someone based on things like that?
I think she'll do a great job.
