Man, I wish. Donald Trump won instead, now we're screwed.
Are you sure about that?
Do you think that will change the course of history?

I'm just worried about the people in Congress.
She can't be any worse than the guy that just left office.
Do you vote for someone based on things like that?
I think she'll do a great job.
