I know.
I'll get it done.
I will do it all tonight.
I know. I need to start working on it.
It will be fine.
What?  I thought it was due next week.
I thought it wasn't do until next week.
I know, but I'm struggling to understand the project.
I'm going to do it now.
Do you want to help me work on it?
Are you serious?
Can you help me out with the project?
Wait, what is the date today?
Have you finished your project?
Oh my God, can you help me?
