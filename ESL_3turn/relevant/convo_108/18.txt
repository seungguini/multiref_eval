Where have you looked?
I guess you better get a new one.
I think I saw it in the cafeteria.
I'll help you find it.
I can't help you if you don't know where you could have lost it.
This is the most expensive pen I have! I need to find it.
Well, then I guess you don't have a pen.
Can you help me look for it?
