I am sure there is another flight you can take, did you check the schedule?
Didn't you hear the announcements?
Were you drunk?
You can grab a hotel by the airport and stay till tommorow and get a flight out in the morning.
Are you going to take a later flight?
I've done that before.
Understandable, that's happened to me before.
Did you have a difficult time getting a new flight?
