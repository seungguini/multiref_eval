I am sure there is another flight you can take, did you check the schedule?
Didn't you hear the announcements?
Were you drunk?
You probably shouldn't drink so much if you're waiting for a flight.
You can grab a hotel by the airport and stay till tommorow and get a flight out in the morning.
I've done that before.
Understandable, that's happened to me before.
Maybe you shouldn't have been at the bar.
