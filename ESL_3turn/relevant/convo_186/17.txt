Let's go and get something.
There's plenty to eat. Do you want me to make you something?
I can make you something to eat in a little bit.
Keep looking.
Do you want to come with me to the grocery store?
If you can wait a half hour, I'll take you somewhere.
Why don't we make burgers?
What did you want to eat?
