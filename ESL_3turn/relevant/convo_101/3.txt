I don't think it will be too hard to adjust.
I understand, but I think you'd adjust well.
I totally understand that part. I'm still getting acclimated here.
How happy are you going to be if you stay here though?

I'm glad you're staying here.
I think you should give it a try.
It's a difficult adjustment at first but you have so much support.
