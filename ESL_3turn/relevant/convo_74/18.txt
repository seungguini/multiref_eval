Can you please elaborate?
Yes, I remember when you were first hired.
Okay, so what can I do for you?
I know. Is there something wrong?
That is good, do you still like it here?
You're not thinking of leaving us, are you?
How many more years do you plan on putting in?
I hope you stay with us another 10 years.
