Yes, I remember when you were first hired.
And why are you telling me that?
Okay, so what can I do for you?
And you've done a great job!
So are you thinking of leaving us?
I know. Is there something wrong?
How many more years do you plan on putting in?
Seems like you can teach me a lot about this place.
