Yes, I remember when you were first hired.
And why are you telling me that?
And you want a raise?
So are you thinking of leaving us?
I know. Is there something wrong?
You're not thinking of leaving us, are you?
How many more years do you plan on putting in?
Seems like you can teach me a lot about this place.
