Yes, I remember when you were first hired.
And why are you telling me that?
Okay, so what can I do for you?
Are you thining of retiring soon or something?
So are you thinking of leaving us?
You're not thinking of leaving us, are you?
How many more years do you plan on putting in?
Seems like you can teach me a lot about this place.
