Yes, I remember when you were first hired.
And you want a raise?
And you've done a great job!
Are you thining of retiring soon or something?
So are you thinking of leaving us?
You're not thinking of leaving us, are you?
I hope you stay with us another 10 years.
Seems like you can teach me a lot about this place.
