Aw, okay. I hope you feel better.
I hope you get feeling better
How long have you not been feeling well?
I have some tylenol if you want!
Are you sure? It's hot out.
I think there's a thermometer in the first aid cabinet if you need it
Do you want me to drive you home?
Now that you mention it, you don't look so good.
