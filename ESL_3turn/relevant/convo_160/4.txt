Aw, okay. I hope you feel better.
I hope you get feeling better
You should get that checked out.
How long have you not been feeling well?
Looks like you never got over your cold.
Are you sure? It's hot out.
I think there's a thermometer in the first aid cabinet if you need it
Now that you mention it, you don't look so good.
