Aw, okay. I hope you feel better.
I hope you get feeling better
How long have you not been feeling well?
I have some tylenol if you want!
Looks like you never got over your cold.
I think there's a thermometer in the first aid cabinet if you need it
Do you want me to drive you home?
So you want me to bring you some soup?
