Aw, okay. I hope you feel better.
How long have you not been feeling well?
Then going home is a good idea.
Looks like you never got over your cold.
Are you sure? It's hot out.
I think there's a thermometer in the first aid cabinet if you need it
Do you want me to drive you home?
Now that you mention it, you don't look so good.
