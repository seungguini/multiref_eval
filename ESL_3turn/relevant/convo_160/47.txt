I hope you get feeling better
You should get that checked out.
Do you need a ride?
Then going home is a good idea.
I think there's a thermometer in the first aid cabinet if you need it
Do you want me to drive you home?
So you want me to bring you some soup?
Now that you mention it, you don't look so good.
