I hope you get feeling better
You should get that checked out.
I have some tylenol if you want!
Looks like you never got over your cold.
I think there's a thermometer in the first aid cabinet if you need it
Do you want me to drive you home?
Now that you mention it, you don't look so good.
Do you need a ride?
