I can give you some suggestions.
If you visit the chamber of commerce site, it gives tourist information.
I can give you some recommendations for places to see.
Your best bet is to head downtown.
I understand that tours aren't for everyone.
Be sure to check out the museum down the street.
That sounds like fun.
