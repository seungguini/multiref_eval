Ok, here are some brochures to look at.
The tour only lasts an hour.  You will have time to explore it on your own afterwards.
I can give you some suggestions.
In that case, I have a map that you can use for free.
I understand that tours aren't for everyone.
That's a good idea.
That's what I like to do too.
Be sure to check out the museum down the street.
