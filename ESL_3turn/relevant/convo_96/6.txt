The tour only lasts an hour.  You will have time to explore it on your own afterwards.
If you visit the chamber of commerce site, it gives tourist information.
A lot of people like to do that.
Your best bet is to head downtown.
Enjoy the sights and sounds of this great city.
That's what I like to do too.
Be sure to check out the museum down the street.
That sounds like fun.
