The tour only lasts an hour.  You will have time to explore it on your own afterwards.
If you visit the chamber of commerce site, it gives tourist information.
What if I upgraded your ticket to a VIP experience?
A lot of people like to do that.
Your best bet is to head downtown.
I understand that tours aren't for everyone.
Enjoy the sights and sounds of this great city.
That sounds like fun.
