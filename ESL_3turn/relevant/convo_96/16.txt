Ok, here are some brochures to look at.
The tour only lasts an hour.  You will have time to explore it on your own afterwards.
I can give you some suggestions.
If you visit the chamber of commerce site, it gives tourist information.
What if I upgraded your ticket to a VIP experience?
Your best bet is to head downtown.
I understand that tours aren't for everyone.
That sounds like fun.
