The tour only lasts an hour.  You will have time to explore it on your own afterwards.
I can give you some suggestions.
If you visit the chamber of commerce site, it gives tourist information.
A lot of people like to do that.
I understand that tours aren't for everyone.
That's a good idea.
That's what I like to do too.
That sounds like fun.
