Ok, here are some brochures to look at.
The tour only lasts an hour.  You will have time to explore it on your own afterwards.
In that case, I have a map that you can use for free.
What if I upgraded your ticket to a VIP experience?
That's a good idea.
Enjoy the sights and sounds of this great city.
That's what I like to do too.
Be sure to check out the museum down the street.
