In that case, I have a map that you can use for free.
What if I upgraded your ticket to a VIP experience?
A lot of people like to do that.
I understand that tours aren't for everyone.
That's a good idea.
That's what I like to do too.
Be sure to check out the museum down the street.
That sounds like fun.
