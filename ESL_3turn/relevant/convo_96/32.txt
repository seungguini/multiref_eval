I can give you some suggestions.
In that case, I have a map that you can use for free.
What if I upgraded your ticket to a VIP experience?
I can give you some recommendations for places to see.
Your best bet is to head downtown.
I understand that tours aren't for everyone.
That's what I like to do too.
