The tour only lasts an hour.  You will have time to explore it on your own afterwards.
I can give you some suggestions.
In that case, I have a map that you can use for free.
If you visit the chamber of commerce site, it gives tourist information.
A lot of people like to do that.
I can give you some recommendations for places to see.
Be sure to check out the museum down the street.
That sounds like fun.
