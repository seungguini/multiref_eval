Ok, here are some brochures to look at.
The tour only lasts an hour.  You will have time to explore it on your own afterwards.
A lot of people like to do that.
I can give you some recommendations for places to see.

I understand that tours aren't for everyone.
That's a good idea.
That's what I like to do too.
