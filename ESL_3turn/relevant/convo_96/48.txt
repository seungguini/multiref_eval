Ok, here are some brochures to look at.
In that case, I have a map that you can use for free.
A lot of people like to do that.
I can give you some recommendations for places to see.
Your best bet is to head downtown.
That's a good idea.
Enjoy the sights and sounds of this great city.
Be sure to check out the museum down the street.
