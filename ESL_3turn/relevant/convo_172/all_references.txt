Life is what you make of it
You're wrong.
School is hard and life is hard.
Yeah right!
at times
Wait 'til you get out and have to survive on your own.
I think that they both are.
It will get better once you're settled down.
only if you make it
You've been spoiled all these years by your parents.
We didn't know how great we had it.
Work is a lot worse huh?
think positive it will get better
Life is amazing though.  It's full of excitement and challenges.
That is back when things were simple.
Yeah, school was pretty bad too.
if it was easy would you be happier
Life is what you make of it.
It was at the time.
I mean, I like working better than school to be honest.
