Life is what you make of it
School is hard and life is hard.
Wait 'til you get out and have to survive on your own.
It will get better once you're settled down.
You've been spoiled all these years by your parents.
Life is amazing though.  It's full of excitement and challenges.
That is back when things were simple.
It was at the time.
