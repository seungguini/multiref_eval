School is hard and life is hard.
Wait 'til you get out and have to survive on your own.
I think that they both are.
It will get better once you're settled down.
Work is a lot worse huh?
Life is amazing though.  It's full of excitement and challenges.
It was at the time.
I mean, I like working better than school to be honest.
