You're wrong.
Wait 'til you get out and have to survive on your own.
You've been spoiled all these years by your parents.
We didn't know how great we had it.
Work is a lot worse huh?
if it was easy would you be happier
Life is what you make of it.
I mean, I like working better than school to be honest.
