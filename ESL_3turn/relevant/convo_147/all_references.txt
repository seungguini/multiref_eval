I'd be drenched if it wasn't for your help.
It's terrible!
I'm soaked already!
I didn't realize your store was open!
It's nice of you to think of my situation.
I know my car is getting hailed on!
It just suddenly started pouring!
Do you sell umbrellas in your shop?
I'm afraid the streets are going to flood!
But a little rain never hurt.
I hate it when it storms like this!
The farms can sure use this.
We really needed rain
