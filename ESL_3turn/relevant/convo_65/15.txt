I agree.
I think you are right.
It's probably the bad perfume they wear.
It makes me feel sick to my stomach.
Since there is a baby smell, I guess it's possible to also have an old person smell.
I don't like the smell of the potpourri they have out.
I wish I could do something about it.
It's very strong.
