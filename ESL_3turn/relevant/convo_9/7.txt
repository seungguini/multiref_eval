This cold is messing up my plans.
I've thrown up twice today.
I have been feeling very sick lately.
I'm scheduled for hernia surgery tomorrow.
I broke up with Steven and he's not taking it very well.
If I throw up again, I'm going to the hospital.
I have been very stressed out.
I might have the stomach virus that's going around.
