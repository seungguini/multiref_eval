I've thrown up twice today.
I'm scheduled for hernia surgery tomorrow.
I broke up with Steven and he's not taking it very well.
I am not sure what's wrong.  Probably something I ate.
If I throw up again, I'm going to the hospital.
I have been very stressed out.
I have a lot on my plate at the moment.
I don't know. Hope it's nothing serious.
