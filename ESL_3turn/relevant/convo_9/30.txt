I have to have dental surgery in a few hours.
This cold is messing up my plans.
I'm scheduled for hernia surgery tomorrow.
I broke up with Steven and he's not taking it very well.
I am not sure what's wrong.  Probably something I ate.
I have been feeling depressed lately.
I might have the stomach virus that's going around.
I have a lot on my plate at the moment.
