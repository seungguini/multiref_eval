Oh my. Have you called them yet?
You better be careful.
Oh no! You need to hire someone to fix it up.
They need to fix that for you.
How long has it been like that?
How come it hasn't been repaired?
You should report it to your landlord. They might cover the repair expenses.
Have you talked to your landlord?
