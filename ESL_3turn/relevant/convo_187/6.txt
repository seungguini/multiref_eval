Oh my. Have you called them yet?
Oh, wow.  What happened?
You better be careful.
Oh no! You need to hire someone to fix it up.
Will the landlord replace it for you?
They need to fix that for you.
You should report it to your landlord. They might cover the repair expenses.
Have you talked to your landlord?
