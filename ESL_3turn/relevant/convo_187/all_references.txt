Oh my. Have you called them yet?
Oh, wow.  What happened?
You better be careful.
Oh no! You need to hire someone to fix it up.
Why haven't you called maintenance?
Will the landlord replace it for you?
They need to fix that for you.
How did it get damaged so bad?
How long has it been like that?
How come it hasn't been repaired?
You should report it to your landlord. They might cover the repair expenses.
Why don't you have them take care of it?
Have you talked to your landlord?
