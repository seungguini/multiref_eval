Oh, wow.  What happened?
Oh no! You need to hire someone to fix it up.
Why haven't you called maintenance?
How did it get damaged so bad?
How long has it been like that?
You should report it to your landlord. They might cover the repair expenses.
Why don't you have them take care of it?
Have you talked to your landlord?
