Oh my. Have you called them yet?
Oh, wow.  What happened?
You better be careful.
Why haven't you called maintenance?
Will the landlord replace it for you?
You should report it to your landlord. They might cover the repair expenses.
Why don't you have them take care of it?
Have you talked to your landlord?
