Oh my. Have you called them yet?
You better be careful.
Oh no! You need to hire someone to fix it up.
Why haven't you called maintenance?
Will the landlord replace it for you?
How did it get damaged so bad?
You should report it to your landlord. They might cover the repair expenses.
Why don't you have them take care of it?
