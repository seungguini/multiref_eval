Oh my. Have you called them yet?
You better be careful.
Will the landlord replace it for you?
They need to fix that for you.
How did it get damaged so bad?
How come it hasn't been repaired?
You should report it to your landlord. They might cover the repair expenses.
Have you talked to your landlord?
