Would you like to do a mock interview with me for practice?
Do you want me to take a look at your resume and cover letters?
I think you'll land one soon.
How many interviews have you gone on?
Who have you tried to meet with?
What are you looking for?
Just keep at it. Don't give up.
I wonder what you are doing wrong.
