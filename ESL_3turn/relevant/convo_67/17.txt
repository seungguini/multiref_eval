That's too bad.   What can I do to help?
Do you want me to take a look at your resume and cover letters?
I think you'll land one soon.
Who have you tried to meet with?
I'm sure if you keep trying you'll get one.
What are you looking for?
Just keep at it. Don't give up.
I wonder what you are doing wrong.
