You might consider dressing up better for your interview.
That's too bad.   What can I do to help?
Do you need a reference? I'd be happy to.
Do you want me to take a look at your resume and cover letters?
How many interviews have you gone on?
Who have you tried to meet with?
I'm sure if you keep trying you'll get one.
I wonder what you are doing wrong.
