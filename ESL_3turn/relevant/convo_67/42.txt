Let me see what I can do.
That's too bad.   What can I do to help?
Do you need a reference? I'd be happy to.
Would you like to do a mock interview with me for practice?
Do you want me to take a look at your resume and cover letters?
How many interviews have you gone on?
I'm sure if you keep trying you'll get one.
Just keep at it. Don't give up.
