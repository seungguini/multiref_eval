If you buy an Apple, six years is nothing.
Does it still work?
Do you want to go shop for one now?
What brands are you looking at?
So is mine, what kind are you thinking of getting?
Are you going to get another PC or a Mac this time?
Have you considered refurbished?
What does that have to do with anything?  If it still works, use it.
