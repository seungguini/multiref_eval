If you buy an Apple, six years is nothing.
Did it stop working?
Have you tried upgrading the RAM and getting a solid state drive?  It may make it run faster.
Are you looking to upgrade to a newer computer?
So is mine, what kind are you thinking of getting?
Are you going to get another PC or a Mac this time?
Have you ever had an Apple?
What does that have to do with anything?  If it still works, use it.
