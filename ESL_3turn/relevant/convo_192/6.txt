If you buy an Apple, six years is nothing.
Did it stop working?
Have you tried upgrading the RAM and getting a solid state drive?  It may make it run faster.
Do you want to go shop for one now?
What brands are you looking at?
Was it a desktop or laptop?
Are you going to get another PC or a Mac this time?
Have you ever had an Apple?
