Did it stop working?
Have you tried upgrading the RAM and getting a solid state drive?  It may make it run faster.
What kind did you have in mind?
Was it a desktop or laptop?
How much cash do you have towards a new one?
Have you ever had an Apple?
Have you considered refurbished?
What does that have to do with anything?  If it still works, use it.
