If you buy an Apple, six years is nothing.
Did it stop working?
What brands are you looking at?
So is mine, what kind are you thinking of getting?
What kind did you have in mind?
Was it a desktop or laptop?
Are you going to get another PC or a Mac this time?
How much cash do you have towards a new one?
