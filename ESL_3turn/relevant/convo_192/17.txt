Does it still work?
Have you tried upgrading the RAM and getting a solid state drive?  It may make it run faster.
Are you looking to upgrade to a newer computer?
So is mine, what kind are you thinking of getting?
What kind did you have in mind?
Was it a desktop or laptop?
How much cash do you have towards a new one?
Have you ever had an Apple?
