If you buy an Apple, six years is nothing.
What brands are you looking at?
So is mine, what kind are you thinking of getting?
Was it a desktop or laptop?
Are you going to get another PC or a Mac this time?
How much cash do you have towards a new one?
Have you considered refurbished?
What does that have to do with anything?  If it still works, use it.
