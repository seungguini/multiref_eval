If you buy an Apple, six years is nothing.
Does it still work?
Have you tried upgrading the RAM and getting a solid state drive?  It may make it run faster.
Do you want to go shop for one now?
What kind did you have in mind?
Are you going to get another PC or a Mac this time?
How much cash do you have towards a new one?
What does that have to do with anything?  If it still works, use it.
