Does it still work?
Have you tried upgrading the RAM and getting a solid state drive?  It may make it run faster.
Do you want to go shop for one now?
So is mine, what kind are you thinking of getting?
Was it a desktop or laptop?
Are you going to get another PC or a Mac this time?
Have you considered refurbished?
What does that have to do with anything?  If it still works, use it.
