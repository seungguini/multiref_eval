This is important though.
If I'm at a stop, I don't think any cop would pull me over.
It's a short one though.
Don't be such a sissy, it's fine the car isn't moving.
If it makes you feel unsafe I won't do it.
I see you texting while driving all the time.
I don't care about the law!
What if it's something urgent?
