You're right, thank you!
Did you not mean to send that to me?
If I'm at a stop, I don't think any cop would pull me over.
Can you read it for me please?
I have pulled over to read it.
I see you texting while driving all the time.
I always respond to text while driving
What if it's something urgent?
