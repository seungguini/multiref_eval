Did you not mean to send that to me?
This is important though.
If I'm at a stop, I don't think any cop would pull me over.
Don't be such a sissy, it's fine the car isn't moving.
I have pulled over to read it.
I see you texting while driving all the time.
I always respond to text while driving
What if it's something urgent?
