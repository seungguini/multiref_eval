Did you not mean to send that to me?
If I'm at a stop, I don't think any cop would pull me over.
Don't be such a sissy, it's fine the car isn't moving.
Can you read it for me please?
I have pulled over to read it.
I always respond to text while driving
What if it's something urgent?
Ok, I'll read it later.
