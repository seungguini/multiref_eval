Less of a hassle than buying new clothes constantly!
Then wear dirty clothes!
Don't be so lazy, everyone does laundry!
There's a laundromat down the block.
Everyone has to do laundry thought!
Well, I don't know what to tell you.
Quit complaining!
It's the worst. Might as well get it over with though.
