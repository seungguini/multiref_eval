It's important to do your chores.
Then wear dirty clothes!
Get it out of the way so you don't have to do it later this week.
There's a laundromat down the block.
Have you thought about a drop off service?
I agree, I hate doing laundry.
Quit complaining!
It's the worst. Might as well get it over with though.
