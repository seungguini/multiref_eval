Less of a hassle than buying new clothes constantly!
Then wear dirty clothes!
Get it out of the way so you don't have to do it later this week.
There's a laundromat down the block.
Everyone has to do laundry thought!
Well, I don't know what to tell you.
I agree, I hate doing laundry.
Quit complaining!
