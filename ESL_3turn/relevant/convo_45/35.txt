Less of a hassle than buying new clothes constantly!
It's important to do your chores.
Get it out of the way so you don't have to do it later this week.
Don't be so lazy, everyone does laundry!
There's a laundromat down the block.
Have you thought about a drop off service?
I agree, I hate doing laundry.
It's the worst. Might as well get it over with though.
