It only takes about an hour.
Less of a hassle than buying new clothes constantly!
Get it out of the way so you don't have to do it later this week.
Don't be so lazy, everyone does laundry!
There's a laundromat down the block.
Everyone has to do laundry thought!
Quit complaining!
It's the worst. Might as well get it over with though.
