I'm so sorry. I can't believe I missed it.
I'm sorry. I didn't see the stop sign.
The stop sign by Wood Street?
It was a rolling stop. A pause, really.
I'm sorry but I did stop at the stop sign. In fact, a dog crossed in front of me.
I'm sorry officer, I should have payed more attention to how I was driving.
Are you serious?
That's not possible.
