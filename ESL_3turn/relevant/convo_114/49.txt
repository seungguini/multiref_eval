is it cooling at all?
Do you know why?
Buying a dehumifier can also help.
Are you sure your air conditioner is working properly?
Maybe you should call and get your air conditioner serviced?
you dont need it, its almost fall
mine has been struggling too
Maybe try finding a new product on Amazon that can help.
