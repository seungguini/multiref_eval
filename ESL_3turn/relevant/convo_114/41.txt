Have you tried a fan?
Buying a dehumifier can also help.
where did you get it?
How much was the air conditioner
Maybe you should call and get your air conditioner serviced?
Would you like to stay the night at my place?
mine has been struggling too
Maybe try finding a new product on Amazon that can help.
