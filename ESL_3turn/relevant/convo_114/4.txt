is it cooling at all?
Have you tried a fan?
Buying a dehumifier can also help.
where did you get it?
Are you sure your air conditioner is working properly?
Maybe you should call and get your air conditioner serviced?
Would you like to stay the night at my place?
Maybe try finding a new product on Amazon that can help.
