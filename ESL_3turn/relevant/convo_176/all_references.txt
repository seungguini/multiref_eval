that knife is sharp
How am I supposed to hold a knife?
I guess that's my answer.
I'll do it my own way.
they are soft
You wanna show me the right way?
Whoops I almost cut myself.
Thanks, I don't want to cut myself.
they are hot
I've been holding it wrong all my life then.
Can you show me the right way?
How should I hold the knife?
you will need the skin for flavoring
I didn't know there was a right way.
There's more than one way to do it.
Oh, I didn't know this was wrong.
you might drop it
It's my preference.
I don't think that I am.
How about I peel your potatoes, bitch?!?
