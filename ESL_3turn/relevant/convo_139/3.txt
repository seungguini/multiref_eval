Freshmen love it
Everyone gains 15 pounds after freshman year.
It's called that because that's when most freshment gain weight; I did.
Just look down at your belly if you want to know!
It is mostly carbs.
It's totally common. Between the lack of parents to dictate diet and often the partying, many first time students get it.
That's horrible.  I am sure the stress doesn't help.
It's a normal phenomenon for freshman college students. It's not always fifteen pounds, but most people gain some weight because of poor diet during college.
