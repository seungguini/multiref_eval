The place where freshman can eat all they want.
It's an idiom to describe the common weight gain freshman students often gain when they first go to college.

Everyone gains 15 pounds after freshman year.

It's totally common. Between the lack of parents to dictate diet and often the partying, many first time students get it.
I think you already found out what it is. Don't worry, I did, too, in my first year.
It's a normal phenomenon for freshman college students. It's not always fifteen pounds, but most people gain some weight because of poor diet during college.
