Freshmen love it
Everyone gains 15 pounds after freshman year.
It's called that because that's when most freshment gain weight; I did.
Just look down at your belly if you want to know!
It is mostly carbs.
All-you-can-eat is deadly.
That's horrible.  I am sure the stress doesn't help.
It's a normal phenomenon for freshman college students. It's not always fifteen pounds, but most people gain some weight because of poor diet during college.
