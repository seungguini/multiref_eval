I am finally.
Yes I am. They got damaged by the last storm we had.
No, I'm just getting the supplies.
No, I'm helping my neighbor.
Yes, do you want to help?
I hired someone to do it for me, but needed to provide some supplies for cheaper pricing.
Yup.  Would you be interested in helping?
I'm going to try.
