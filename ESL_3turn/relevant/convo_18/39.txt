I used to work as a driver.
I've never done this before.
This is shameful for me, sorry.
What kind of unemployment benefits do I receive?
What kind of forms do I have to fill out?
The job market really sucks these days.
Do you know how much money I'll be making?
How long do I have to start the process?
