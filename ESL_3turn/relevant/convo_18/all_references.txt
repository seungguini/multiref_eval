I used to work as a driver.
How do I go about it?
How do I start?
What's my first step?
I've never done this before.
Is it a complicated process?
Should I come to the office?
This is shameful for me, sorry.
What kind of unemployment benefits do I receive?
Can I do it over the phone?
How much will I make on unemployment?
That's good to hear, the situation isn't good right now.
What kind of forms do I have to fill out?
Can I still look for a job?
The job market really sucks these days.
Do you know how much money I'll be making?
How long do I have to start the process?
