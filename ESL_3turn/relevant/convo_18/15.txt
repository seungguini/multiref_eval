What's my first step?
Should I come to the office?
This is shameful for me, sorry.
How much will I make on unemployment?
That's good to hear, the situation isn't good right now.
What kind of forms do I have to fill out?
Do you know how much money I'll be making?
How long do I have to start the process?
