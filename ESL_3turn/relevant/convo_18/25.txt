I used to work as a driver.
Is it a complicated process?
This is shameful for me, sorry.
What kind of unemployment benefits do I receive?
That's good to hear, the situation isn't good right now.
What kind of forms do I have to fill out?
Can I still look for a job?
Do you know how much money I'll be making?
