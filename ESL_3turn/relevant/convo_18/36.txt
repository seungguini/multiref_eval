I used to work as a driver.
I've never done this before.
What kind of unemployment benefits do I receive?
Can I do it over the phone?
That's good to hear, the situation isn't good right now.
What kind of forms do I have to fill out?
The job market really sucks these days.
Do you know how much money I'll be making?
