What's my first step?
Should I come to the office?
What kind of unemployment benefits do I receive?
Can I do it over the phone?
How much will I make on unemployment?
That's good to hear, the situation isn't good right now.
What kind of forms do I have to fill out?
How long do I have to start the process?
