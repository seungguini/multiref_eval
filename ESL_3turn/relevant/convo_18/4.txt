How do I go about it?
Should I come to the office?
This is shameful for me, sorry.
What kind of unemployment benefits do I receive?
That's good to hear, the situation isn't good right now.
Can I still look for a job?
The job market really sucks these days.
Do you know how much money I'll be making?
