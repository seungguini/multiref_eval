Where are you heading?
There's a bus stop every few blocks.
I have a bus map I can lend to you.
I'm not sure.
The transit station is on the next corner and you can get just about anywhere from there.
They are everywhere.
Go up to the intersection and make a left, then you'll see the bus shelter on the right.
Where do you want to go?
