There's a bus stop every few blocks.
I have a bus map I can lend to you.
The transit station is on the next corner and you can get just about anywhere from there.
Where are you trying to travel to? They all go to different destinations.
There is a bus stop near the grocery store.
Go up to the intersection and make a left, then you'll see the bus shelter on the right.
Where do you want to go?
The station is right there.
