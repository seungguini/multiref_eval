Where are you heading?
I have a bus map I can lend to you.
I'm not sure.
The transit station is on the next corner and you can get just about anywhere from there.
They are everywhere.
There is a bus stop near the grocery store.
Go up to the intersection and make a left, then you'll see the bus shelter on the right.
Where do you want to go?
