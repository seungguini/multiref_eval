Where are you heading?
I have a bus map I can lend to you.
I'm not sure.
The transit station is on the next corner and you can get just about anywhere from there.
Where are you trying to travel to? They all go to different destinations.
There is a bus stop near the grocery store.
Go up to the intersection and make a left, then you'll see the bus shelter on the right.
Where do you want to go?
