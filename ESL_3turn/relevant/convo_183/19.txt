There's a bus stop every few blocks.
I have a bus map I can lend to you.
I'm not sure.
They are everywhere.
Where are you trying to travel to? They all go to different destinations.
There is a bus stop near the grocery store.
Go up to the intersection and make a left, then you'll see the bus shelter on the right.
The station is right there.
