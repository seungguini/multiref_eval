Just over a year.  I am still meeting new people all the time.
That's great.  How do you like it here?
I love the people here. Such a tight community.
Only a day or so.
I'm just kidding, can I interest you in some knives?
Do you have children
Everyone looks out for one another here.
About 10 years.
