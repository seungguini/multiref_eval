Just over a year.  I am still meeting new people all the time.
I've been here for 20 years.
We have monthly festivals in the square near the school
I love the people here. Such a tight community.
Everyone looks out for one another here.
I've lived here for a long time.  I know everyone and everyone's dirty laundry.
Let me think about how long it's been.
I lived here, like my father, and his father before him.
