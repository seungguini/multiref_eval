if you need any thing just let us know
Just over a year.  I am still meeting new people all the time.
My wife and I moved in just last week period
We have monthly festivals in the square near the school
I love the people here. Such a tight community.
Only a day or so.
I've lived here for a long time.  I know everyone and everyone's dirty laundry.
Let me think about how long it's been.
