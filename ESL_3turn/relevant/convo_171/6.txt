if you need any thing just let us know
Since the beginning of time.
That's great.  How do you like it here?
We have monthly festivals in the square near the school
Do you have children
We have a block club meeting every month to keep acquainted
I've lived here for a long time.  I know everyone and everyone's dirty laundry.
I lived here, like my father, and his father before him.
