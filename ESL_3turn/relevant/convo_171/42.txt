Just over a year.  I am still meeting new people all the time.
Since the beginning of time.
My wife and I moved in just last week period
Only a day or so.
About 10 years.
Going on twelve years.
I've lived here for a long time.  I know everyone and everyone's dirty laundry.
Let me think about how long it's been.
