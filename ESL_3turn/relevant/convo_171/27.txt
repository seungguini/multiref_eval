I've been here for 20 years.
My wife and I moved in just last week period
I don't actually live here.
Do you have children
Going on twelve years.
I've lived here for a long time.  I know everyone and everyone's dirty laundry.
Let me think about how long it's been.
I lived here, like my father, and his father before him.
