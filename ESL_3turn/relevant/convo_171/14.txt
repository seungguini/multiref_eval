if you need any thing just let us know
I've been here for 20 years.
That's great.  How do you like it here?
We have monthly festivals in the square near the school
I love the people here. Such a tight community.
I'm just kidding, can I interest you in some knives?
We have a block club meeting every month to keep acquainted
I've lived here for a long time.  I know everyone and everyone's dirty laundry.
