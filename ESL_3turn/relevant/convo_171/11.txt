I've been here for 20 years.
That's great.  How do you like it here?
I love the people here. Such a tight community.
Do you have children
Everyone looks out for one another here.
We have a block club meeting every month to keep acquainted
I've lived here for a long time.  I know everyone and everyone's dirty laundry.
Let me think about how long it's been.
