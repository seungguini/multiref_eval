I've been here for 20 years.
My wife and I moved in just last week period
I don't actually live here.
Only a day or so.
I'm just kidding, can I interest you in some knives?
Do you have children
Everyone looks out for one another here.
I've lived here for a long time.  I know everyone and everyone's dirty laundry.
