if you need any thing just let us know
Just over a year.  I am still meeting new people all the time.
I don't actually live here.
We have monthly festivals in the square near the school
I love the people here. Such a tight community.
I'm just kidding, can I interest you in some knives?
We have a block club meeting every month to keep acquainted
Let me think about how long it's been.
