I've been here for 20 years.
Since the beginning of time.
That's great.  How do you like it here?
I don't actually live here.
We have monthly festivals in the square near the school
I'm just kidding, can I interest you in some knives?
I've lived here for a long time.  I know everyone and everyone's dirty laundry.
Let me think about how long it's been.
