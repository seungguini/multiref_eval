if you need any thing just let us know
Just over a year.  I am still meeting new people all the time.
My wife and I moved in just last week period
I'm just kidding, can I interest you in some knives?
Do you have children
About 10 years.
I've lived here for a long time.  I know everyone and everyone's dirty laundry.
I lived here, like my father, and his father before him.
