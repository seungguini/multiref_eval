if you need any thing just let us know
That's great.  How do you like it here?
My wife and I moved in just last week period
I don't actually live here.
We have monthly festivals in the square near the school
Do you have children
I've lived here for a long time.  I know everyone and everyone's dirty laundry.
Let me think about how long it's been.
