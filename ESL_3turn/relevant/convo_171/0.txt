if you need any thing just let us know
My wife and I moved in just last week period
I don't actually live here.
We have monthly festivals in the square near the school
Only a day or so.
Going on twelve years.
I've lived here for a long time.  I know everyone and everyone's dirty laundry.
I lived here, like my father, and his father before him.
