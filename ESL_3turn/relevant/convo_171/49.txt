if you need any thing just let us know
That's great.  How do you like it here?
I don't actually live here.
We have monthly festivals in the square near the school
I love the people here. Such a tight community.
Do you have children
I've lived here for a long time.  I know everyone and everyone's dirty laundry.
I lived here, like my father, and his father before him.
