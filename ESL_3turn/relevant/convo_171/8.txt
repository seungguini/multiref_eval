Just over a year.  I am still meeting new people all the time.
That's great.  How do you like it here?
Only a day or so.
I'm just kidding, can I interest you in some knives?
About 10 years.
Going on twelve years.
I've lived here for a long time.  I know everyone and everyone's dirty laundry.
Let me think about how long it's been.
