Isn't he worried about his health?
That's not good for him at all!
Well you never know.
That's reprehensible!
Think of all the money he's wasting on cigarettes.
3 packs of cigarettes?
Of course.
Smoking is disgusting!
Yuck that's so gross.
That makes sense.
My sister smokes 4 packs a day.
That's ridiculous!
Does your mom know that your brother does that?
No one can smoke 3!
