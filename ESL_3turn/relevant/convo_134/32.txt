Because they can.
Well, I know who I call when I'm in serious trouble, 911.
I think they like to do both.
They may need to reach a quota.
I can't stand the officers.  They are so tough.
The tickets they write are part of keeping people safe.
I think these people are parked on a no parking zone.
I'd rather get a ticket than get robbed!
