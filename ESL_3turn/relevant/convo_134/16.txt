If they weren't there at all, you'd like it less.
Well, I know who I call when I'm in serious trouble, 911.
I think they like to do both.
I can't stand the officers.  They are so tough.
Traffic tickets are what most people think of first.
I think these people are parked on a no parking zone.
At least they are patrolling the city.
I'd rather get a ticket than get robbed!
