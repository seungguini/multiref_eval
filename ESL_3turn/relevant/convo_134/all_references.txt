You must have gotten a lot of tickets to think that way.
If they weren't there at all, you'd like it less.
You may be right, it is close to the end of the month.
Because they can.
Well, I know who I call when I'm in serious trouble, 911.
I think they like to do both.
They may need to reach a quota.
I can't stand the officers.  They are so tough.
Traffic tickets are what most people think of first.
The tickets they write are part of keeping people safe.
I think these people are parked on a no parking zone.
You're just angry because of that speeding ticket you got last week.
At least they are patrolling the city.
I'd rather get a ticket than get robbed!
