You must have gotten a lot of tickets to think that way.
If they weren't there at all, you'd like it less.
You may be right, it is close to the end of the month.
I think they like to do both.
Traffic tickets are what most people think of first.
I think these people are parked on a no parking zone.
You're just angry because of that speeding ticket you got last week.
I'd rather get a ticket than get robbed!
