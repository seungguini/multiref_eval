You must have gotten a lot of tickets to think that way.
I think they like to do both.
They may need to reach a quota.
Traffic tickets are what most people think of first.
The tickets they write are part of keeping people safe.
You're just angry because of that speeding ticket you got last week.
At least they are patrolling the city.
I'd rather get a ticket than get robbed!
