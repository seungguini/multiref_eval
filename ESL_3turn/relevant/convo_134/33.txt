You must have gotten a lot of tickets to think that way.
You may be right, it is close to the end of the month.

Well, I know who I call when I'm in serious trouble, 911.

You're just angry because of that speeding ticket you got last week.
At least they are patrolling the city.
I'd rather get a ticket than get robbed!
