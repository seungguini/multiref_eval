You must have gotten a lot of tickets to think that way.
Because they can.
I think they like to do both.
They may need to reach a quota.
I can't stand the officers.  They are so tough.
You're just angry because of that speeding ticket you got last week.
At least they are patrolling the city.
I'd rather get a ticket than get robbed!
