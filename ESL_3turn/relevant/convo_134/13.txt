You must have gotten a lot of tickets to think that way.
If they weren't there at all, you'd like it less.
Because they can.
Well, I know who I call when I'm in serious trouble, 911.
I think they like to do both.
Traffic tickets are what most people think of first.
I think these people are parked on a no parking zone.
At least they are patrolling the city.
