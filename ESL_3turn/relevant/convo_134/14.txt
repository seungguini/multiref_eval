You must have gotten a lot of tickets to think that way.
Well, I know who I call when I'm in serious trouble, 911.
They may need to reach a quota.
I can't stand the officers.  They are so tough.
Traffic tickets are what most people think of first.
The tickets they write are part of keeping people safe.
At least they are patrolling the city.
I'd rather get a ticket than get robbed!
