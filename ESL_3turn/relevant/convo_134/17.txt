You must have gotten a lot of tickets to think that way.
If they weren't there at all, you'd like it less.
Because they can.
I can't stand the officers.  They are so tough.
The tickets they write are part of keeping people safe.
You're just angry because of that speeding ticket you got last week.
At least they are patrolling the city.
I'd rather get a ticket than get robbed!
