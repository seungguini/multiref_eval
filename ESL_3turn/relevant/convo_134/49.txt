You must have gotten a lot of tickets to think that way.
If they weren't there at all, you'd like it less.
They may need to reach a quota.
I can't stand the officers.  They are so tough.
Traffic tickets are what most people think of first.
The tickets they write are part of keeping people safe.
I think these people are parked on a no parking zone.
I'd rather get a ticket than get robbed!
