You must have gotten a lot of tickets to think that way.
Because they can.
Well, I know who I call when I'm in serious trouble, 911.
They may need to reach a quota.

Traffic tickets are what most people think of first.
I think these people are parked on a no parking zone.
I'd rather get a ticket than get robbed!
