This is my first day on the job so I actually don't know that answer!
You can purchase one at that kiosk down there.
Oh no, sorry, I'm not from around here.
You can go to the transit office.
There's a kiosk just across the street that sells passes!
I don't know where you can purchase one.
Just go to the kiosk over there!
I usually just pay with cash or show my student ID.
