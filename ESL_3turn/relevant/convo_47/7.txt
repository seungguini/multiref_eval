This is my first day on the job so I actually don't know that answer!
Oh no, sorry, I'm not from around here.
You can go to the transit office.
I don't know where you can purchase one.
Just go to the kiosk over there!
You can order one over the phone.
Your subway pass should work for the bus.
I usually just pay with cash or show my student ID.
