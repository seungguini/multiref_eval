This is my first day on the job so I actually don't know that answer!
You can purchase one at that kiosk down there.
Oh no, sorry, I'm not from around here.
You can go to the transit office.
There's a kiosk just across the street that sells passes!
Your subway pass should work for the bus.
I do not know where to get one.
I usually just pay with cash or show my student ID.
