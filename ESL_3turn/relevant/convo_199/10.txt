Why would I step over there if it's falling apart?
Okay, over where?
Wow, somebody's going to get hurt if we don't fix that.
This floor board is all rotted out.

Alright, but if I fall through it you're paying my hospital bill.
You're right, it is falling apart.
The landlord is responsible for these repairs.
