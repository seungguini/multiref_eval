No way, i don't want to fall!
Why would I step over there if it's falling apart?
Okay, over where?
Wow, somebody's going to get hurt if we don't fix that.
No, I believe you.
Ok, let's go to Lowe's and get some supplies.
Alright, but if I fall through it you're paying my hospital bill.
I stepped there before and didn't notice anything
