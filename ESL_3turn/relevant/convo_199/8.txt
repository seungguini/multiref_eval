I'm suing you for telling me to step there.
Look, this tile is popping off.
Why would I step over there if it's falling apart?
This floor board is all rotted out.
No, I believe you.
Ok, let's go to Lowe's and get some supplies.
Alright, but if I fall through it you're paying my hospital bill.
Call the guy.
