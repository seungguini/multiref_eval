No way, i don't want to fall!
I'm suing you for telling me to step there.
Why would I step over there if it's falling apart?
Okay, over where?
This floor board is all rotted out.
Ok, let's go to Lowe's and get some supplies.
I stepped there before and didn't notice anything
You're right, it is falling apart.
