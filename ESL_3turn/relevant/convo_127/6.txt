I appreciate your hospitality.
Maybe you can come to my place tomorrow.
I appreciate getting to see you and your apartment.
You have a very nice apartment.
Yes, it's nice meeting new people.
How many tenants have you been able to meet?
How long have you been living here?
Do you have tenants over to your apartment often?
