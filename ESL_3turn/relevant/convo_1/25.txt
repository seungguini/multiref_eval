I think cremation is better.
I really haven't thought about it.
I'll probably want to be buried so my family can visit my grave.
Definitely cremated, the casket business is a racket.
I would like to get buried next to my relatives.
It's such a morbid thought.  I don't know.
Not sure yet. Whichever option is cheaper.
I'm thinking about getting cremated.
