I moved in about a month ago.
Only for a little while.
We just moved in.
We've lived here for ten years!
I've lived here all my life.
Just a month or 2.
We've been here since December.
We've only been here for a year, but we love it.
I grew up a few blocks from here.
We moved in in February.
A little over a year period
About 12 years now.
