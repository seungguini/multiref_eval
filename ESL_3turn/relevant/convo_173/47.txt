I don't have any money to spend there
Why do you need another sweater?  You have a whole closet full.
What kind of sweater are you going to get?
Summer just started.  It's the wrong season to shop for sweaters.
How are you going to afford that?
Is it gonna be an ugly sweater?
That would be fun.  Let me tell my mom.
You should get one that matches mine.
