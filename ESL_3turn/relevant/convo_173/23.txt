I don't have any money to spend there
Why do you need another sweater?  You have a whole closet full.
You're going to buy another sweater that you're never going to wear?
Is it for a special occasion?
maybe later
You just love to spend money.
Summer just started.  It's the wrong season to shop for sweaters.
How are you going to afford that?
