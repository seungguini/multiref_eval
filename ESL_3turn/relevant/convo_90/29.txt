No it's included in your stay.
There is no charge to use the fitness center when you are guest.
All guests can use it for free.
It costs $10 a day to use the gym.
Not if you're a guest in the hotel.
You get free visits to the gym if you stay at the hotel for 5 or more days.
No there's not.
I don't believe so.
