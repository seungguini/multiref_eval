Or maybe they forgot about us.
Maybe so, but it doesn't usually get busy there at this time.
I'm getting annoyed.
I wonder why they are so busy.
I'm starving, I hope it comes soon.
Is their service always this slow?
I'm getting so hungry I feel like I'm going to faint.
I don't see anyone else waiting for food.
