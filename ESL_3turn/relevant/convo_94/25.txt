Do you think they forgot to put the order in?
I think they are just slow.
Maybe so, but it doesn't usually get busy there at this time.
Maybe we should just leave.
I'm starving, I hope it comes soon.
Should we talk to the manager?
Is their service always this slow?
I'm getting so hungry I feel like I'm going to faint.
