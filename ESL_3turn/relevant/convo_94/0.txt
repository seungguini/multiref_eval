I think they are just slow.
Maybe so, but it doesn't usually get busy there at this time.
I'm getting annoyed.
Should we talk to the manager?
I don't know what could be taking so long.
Is their service always this slow?
I'm getting so hungry I feel like I'm going to faint.
It's getting kind of ridiculous.
