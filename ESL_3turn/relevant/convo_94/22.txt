Or maybe they forgot about us.
Do you think they forgot to put the order in?
I think they are just slow.
Maybe so, but it doesn't usually get busy there at this time.
I wonder why they are so busy.
Should we talk to the manager?
I don't know what could be taking so long.
It's getting kind of ridiculous.
