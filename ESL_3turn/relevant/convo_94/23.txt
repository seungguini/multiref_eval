Or maybe they forgot about us.
Do you think they forgot to put the order in?
I hope our food isn't cold.
I wonder why they are so busy.
I'm starving, I hope it comes soon.
Is their service always this slow?
I'm getting so hungry I feel like I'm going to faint.
I don't see anyone else waiting for food.
