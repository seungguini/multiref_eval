Or maybe they forgot about us.
I think they are just slow.
Maybe so, but it doesn't usually get busy there at this time.
Maybe we should just leave.
I hope our food isn't cold.
I don't know what could be taking so long.
I'm getting so hungry I feel like I'm going to faint.
It's getting kind of ridiculous.
