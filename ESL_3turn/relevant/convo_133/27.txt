I'll take the beer any day.
I prefer beer any day of the week,
I prefer both, but I probably smoke more.
Surely, you don't put beer and cigs in the same category. Cigarettes will kill you.
I can have beer anytime.
Not cigarettes! I can't stand the smell.
I prefer beer.
I try to stay away from all drugs.
