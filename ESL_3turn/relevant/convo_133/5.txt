I'll take the beer any day.
I prefer beer any day of the week,
I don't like either.
I prefer both, but I probably smoke more.
Surely, you don't put beer and cigs in the same category. Cigarettes will kill you.
Beer, it doesn't give you cancer!
A cold beer is like so American, just like hot dogs.
I try to stay away from all drugs.
