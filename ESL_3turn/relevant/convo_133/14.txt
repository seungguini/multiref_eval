I don't like either.
I prefer both, but I probably smoke more.
Surely, you don't put beer and cigs in the same category. Cigarettes will kill you.
Beer, it doesn't give you cancer!
I can have beer anytime.
Neither.  I don't drink or smoke.
A cold beer is like so American, just like hot dogs.
Not cigarettes! I can't stand the smell.
