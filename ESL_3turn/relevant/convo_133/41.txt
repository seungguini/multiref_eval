I prefer beer any day of the week,
Surely, you don't put beer and cigs in the same category. Cigarettes will kill you.
Beer, it doesn't give you cancer!
I can have beer anytime.
A cold beer is like so American, just like hot dogs.
Not cigarettes! I can't stand the smell.
Neither, I like to be healthy.
I prefer beer.
