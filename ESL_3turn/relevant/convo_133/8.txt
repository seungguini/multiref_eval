I don't like either.
I prefer both, but I probably smoke more.
Surely, you don't put beer and cigs in the same category. Cigarettes will kill you.
I can have beer anytime.
A cold beer is like so American, just like hot dogs.
Not cigarettes! I can't stand the smell.
Neither, I like to be healthy.
I try to stay away from all drugs.
