Please tell me what they say about apples please
An apple a day keeps the doctor away.
You believe everything you hear?
Please don't tell me and let me enjoy my apple.
They say apples send you to the bathroom, oh well!
Why not?  You should too.
I like to keep the doctor away.
Nevermind, I just like them.
