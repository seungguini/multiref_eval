Please tell me what they say about apples please
You believe everything you hear?
Apples are the people's fruit
Please don't tell me and let me enjoy my apple.
Grandma always said they made her regular
You've never heard that phrase?
They say apples send you to the bathroom, oh well!
I like to keep the doctor away.
