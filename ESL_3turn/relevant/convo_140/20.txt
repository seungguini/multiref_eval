I like sitting on the aisle seat.
Window seats make me feel nauseous!
I don't like looking outside because it makes me nervous.
So that means that I never get to sit by the window when I travel with you?
It doesn't matter much on such a cloudy day!
OK you can sit there!
I do too i suppose
Glad you got that seat then.
