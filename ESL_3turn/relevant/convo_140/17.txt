I like sitting on the aisle seat.
I think it's scary.
Window seats make me feel nauseous!
I don't like looking outside because it makes me nervous.
So that means that I never get to sit by the window when I travel with you?
OK you can sit there!
Yeah I like being able to look outside too.
Glad you got that seat then.
