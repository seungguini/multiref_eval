To me, one seat is the same as the next.
I like sitting on the aisle seat.
I think it's scary.
Window seats make me feel nauseous!
I don't like looking outside because it makes me nervous.
So that means that I never get to sit by the window when I travel with you?
You always have been that way.
It doesn't matter much on such a cloudy day!
OK you can sit there!
I do too i suppose
Yeah I like being able to look outside too.
Windows are cool.
Glad you got that seat then.
