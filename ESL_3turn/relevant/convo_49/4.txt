Better than all the tornadoes back east!
They don't happen that often.
What does that have to do with anything?
Don't be so alarmist.
I would still love to go to California.
There are much better reasons why people from California are crazy.
I hear the traffic is insane.
I imagine it would be a fun place to vacation.
