I live in the area
This place has amazing food.
Because I love the food.
Because I like the food...
this is my new neighborhood
My boyfriend works here.
I actually come to see you.
I have meetings here.
I enjoy this place
I get free food.
I live just right down the street.
I just really like the vibe of this place.
the food is great
It's close to my home.
I was asking myself the same thing.
This was my dead wife's favorite place to eat.
I need a job you guy hiring
People are so friendly here.
Do I need a reason?
Because I have a crush on you.
