The sign said the next two stops, so about 20 minutes.
Seven miles.
It's probably a few miles ahead, should not be far.
In a mile or so.  Not too far.
We'll be there in no time.
It's after the next exit.
Exactly two miles.
We are coming up to one.  It's on the next block.
I saw a sign before that said there is one on exit 52.
The next exit is one and a half miles away.
I see one coming up now.
The next one is about 10 minutes away
