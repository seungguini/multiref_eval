Seven miles.
It's probably a few miles ahead, should not be far.
In a mile or so.  Not too far.
It's after the next exit.
We are coming up to one.  It's on the next block.
I saw a sign before that said there is one on exit 52.
The next exit is one and a half miles away.
The next one is about 10 minutes away
