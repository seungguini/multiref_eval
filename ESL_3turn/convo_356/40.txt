Only one.
I only applied to one school.
I also got accepted to the four schools I applied to.
I decided I'm not going.
I don't think I want to go to college.
None.  I got early acceptance at Harvard based on my SAT scores.
None.  My mom knows someone at Stanford.
It feels like every single one of them.
