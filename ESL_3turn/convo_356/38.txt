I decided to take a year off.
I applied to three schools.
I also got accepted to the four schools I applied to.
I decided I'm not going.
I haven't finished applying yet.
None.  I got early acceptance at Harvard based on my SAT scores.
Any one I could think of.
It feels like every single one of them.
