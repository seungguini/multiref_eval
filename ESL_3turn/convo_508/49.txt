You like his opponent instead?
I really like the mayor.
Well who are you voting for then?
You mean you're not voting for the incumbent, or you're not voting at all?
I'm going to vote for the republican candidate.
Well, I should hope you were only voting for yourself. Ha ha I'm so funny.
I'm not sure I'm going to vote this time around.
