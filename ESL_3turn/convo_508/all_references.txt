Why not?
Why not?
Me either, I can't stand that.
Me neither.
You like his opponent instead?
Who cares about the mayor? I meant the governor?
Yea, the mayor is the worst.
I really like the mayor.
We don't have a mayor here, we have a city council. Jeez.
Well who are you voting for then?
You mean you're not voting for the incumbent, or you're not voting at all?
I'm going to vote for the republican candidate.
Well, I should hope you were only voting for yourself. Ha ha I'm so funny.
I'm not sure I'm going to vote this time around.
