I hope the cameras didn't catch you.
I'm just glad a cop didn't see you.
I hope you don't end up getting a ticket.
Don't worry. I know a good place three block away.
Wow, that was close. You just missed that car.
Well at least there was nobody around.
You really need to pay more attention to the road.
I think I may have had a heart attack.
