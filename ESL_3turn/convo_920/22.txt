If that camera caught your plate then you're going to get a ticket.
I hope the cameras didn't catch you.
I'm just glad a cop didn't see you.

Well at least there was nobody around.
You really need to pay more attention to the road.
Jesus Christ! You can't be doing stuff like that.
I think I may have had a heart attack.
