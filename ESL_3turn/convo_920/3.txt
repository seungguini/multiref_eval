I hope the cameras didn't catch you.
We can return at the next signal.
I'm just glad a cop didn't see you.
Oh no, I think you're going to get a ticket.
Don't worry. I know a good place three block away.
Wow, that was close. You just missed that car.
You really need to pay more attention to the road.
I think I may have had a heart attack.
