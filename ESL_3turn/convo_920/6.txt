I hope the cameras didn't catch you.
I'm just glad a cop didn't see you.
I hope you don't end up getting a ticket.
Oh no, I think you're going to get a ticket.
Wow, that was close. You just missed that car.
You really need to pay more attention to the road.
Jesus Christ! You can't be doing stuff like that.
I think I may have had a heart attack.
