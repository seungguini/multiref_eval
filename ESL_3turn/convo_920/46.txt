If that camera caught your plate then you're going to get a ticket.
I hope the cameras didn't catch you.
We can return at the next signal.
I'm just glad a cop didn't see you.
Don't worry. I know a good place three block away.
Wow, that was close. You just missed that car.
Well at least there was nobody around.
Jesus Christ! You can't be doing stuff like that.
