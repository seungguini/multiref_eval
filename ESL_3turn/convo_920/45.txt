We can return at the next signal.
I'm just glad a cop didn't see you.
Oh no, I think you're going to get a ticket.
Don't worry. I know a good place three block away.
Wow, that was close. You just missed that car.
Well at least there was nobody around.
You really need to pay more attention to the road.
I think I may have had a heart attack.
