I hope the cameras didn't catch you.
We can return at the next signal.
I'm just glad a cop didn't see you.
I hope you don't end up getting a ticket.
Oh no, I think you're going to get a ticket.
Well at least there was nobody around.
Jesus Christ! You can't be doing stuff like that.
I think I may have had a heart attack.
