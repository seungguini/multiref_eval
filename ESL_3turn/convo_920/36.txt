If that camera caught your plate then you're going to get a ticket.
I hope the cameras didn't catch you.
I'm just glad a cop didn't see you.
Don't worry. I know a good place three block away.
Wow, that was close. You just missed that car.
You really need to pay more attention to the road.
Jesus Christ! You can't be doing stuff like that.
I think I may have had a heart attack.
