If that camera caught your plate then you're going to get a ticket.
I hope the cameras didn't catch you.
We can return at the next signal.
Don't worry. I know a good place three block away.
Wow, that was close. You just missed that car.
Well at least there was nobody around.
You really need to pay more attention to the road.
I think I may have had a heart attack.
