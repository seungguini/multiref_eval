I hope the cameras didn't catch you.
I'm just glad a cop didn't see you.
Don't worry. I know a good place three block away.
Wow, that was close. You just missed that car.
Well at least there was nobody around.
You really need to pay more attention to the road.
Jesus Christ! You can't be doing stuff like that.
I think I may have had a heart attack.
