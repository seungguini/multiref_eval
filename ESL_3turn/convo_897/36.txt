It's only two blocks from the park with the nice walking trail.
It has a friendly neighborhood with lots of views.
It is in the metro area and close to all the things you need.
There is very low crime in this area.
There's plenty of parking on the street in front of the building.
The crime is really low.
It is located close to everything in town.
It's close enough that I can ride my bike to work.
