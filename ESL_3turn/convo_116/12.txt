How about the local art fair next weekend?
Then I suggest either fancy restaurants or the movies.
You two couldn't have visited all of the museums and amusement parks in the country.
Try Groupon or Living Social; they often have unique ideas and discounted tickets for attractions.
Did you check the county website for local events?
How about miniature golf?
Perhaps a stroll in the park would be nice.
There isn't a limit to many museums and amusement parks you can go to.
