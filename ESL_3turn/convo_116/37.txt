How about the local art fair next weekend?
Then I suggest either fancy restaurants or the movies.
You two couldn't have visited all of the museums and amusement parks in the country.
Try Groupon or Living Social; they often have unique ideas and discounted tickets for attractions.
I know this one beautiful spot my girlfriend and I go on picnics.
Well, why don't you go online to get some ideas?
What about the beach?
Perhaps a stroll in the park would be nice.
