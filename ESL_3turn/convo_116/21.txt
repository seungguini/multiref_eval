How about the local art fair next weekend?
Then I suggest either fancy restaurants or the movies.
You two couldn't have visited all of the museums and amusement parks in the country.
Did you check the county website for local events?
Well, why don't you go online to get some ideas?
How about miniature golf?
What about the beach?
Perhaps a stroll in the park would be nice.
