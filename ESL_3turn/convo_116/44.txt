You two couldn't have visited all of the museums and amusement parks in the country.
Try Groupon or Living Social; they often have unique ideas and discounted tickets for attractions.

Perhaps a stroll in the park would be nice.
There isn't a limit to many museums and amusement parks you can go to.
