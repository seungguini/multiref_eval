How about the local art fair next weekend?
Then I suggest either fancy restaurants or the movies.
You two couldn't have visited all of the museums and amusement parks in the country.
Try Groupon or Living Social; they often have unique ideas and discounted tickets for attractions.
Did you check the county website for local events?
Well, why don't you go online to get some ideas?
How about miniature golf?
There isn't a limit to many museums and amusement parks you can go to.
