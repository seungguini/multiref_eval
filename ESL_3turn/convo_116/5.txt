How about the local art fair next weekend?
Then I suggest either fancy restaurants or the movies.
Try Groupon or Living Social; they often have unique ideas and discounted tickets for attractions.
Did you check the county website for local events?
I know this one beautiful spot my girlfriend and I go on picnics.
Well, why don't you go online to get some ideas?
How about miniature golf?
Perhaps a stroll in the park would be nice.
