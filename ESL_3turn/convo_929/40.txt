Well you've come to the right place! Give me a moment and i'll get you set up.
No problem, we have computers and laptops available for you.
I can help you out. What kind of job are you interested in?
You could use our computer station.
If you get a library card then you'll be able to use one of our public computers.
Let me show you the list of jobs that are available.
I'm sorry but that's not something that I would be able to help you with.
I can help you and you can use the computer here.
