No problem, we have computers and laptops available for you.
Please use this password to connect internet.
You could use our computer station.
You can use any computer over there.
Could you use the computer's at school?
Awesome, I can definitely help you with that.
If you get a library card then you'll be able to use one of our public computers.
I'm sorry but that's not something that I would be able to help you with.
