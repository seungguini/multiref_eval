Well people just don't feel like their vote matters anymore.
Well if people would get out and vote it might have been different.
I'm completely serious.
This is what happens when no one votes.
I know, it's crazy!
It's only a democracy when people actually show up to the polls.
You're right, it is.
What's wrong with people?
