Well people just don't feel like their vote matters anymore.
Well if people would get out and vote it might have been different.
I know, we should all be more concerned with voting.
You are right, it is a joke.
It's only a democracy when people actually show up to the polls.
You're right, it is.
How could people not turn out?
What's wrong with people?
