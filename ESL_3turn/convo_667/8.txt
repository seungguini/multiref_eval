I'm completely serious.
This is what happens when no one votes.
I know, we should all be more concerned with voting.
You are right, it is a joke.
I know, it's crazy!
It's only a democracy when people actually show up to the polls.
What's wrong with people?
I don't know what this country is going to do!
