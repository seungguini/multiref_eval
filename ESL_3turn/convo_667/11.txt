Well people just don't feel like their vote matters anymore.
This is what happens when no one votes.
You are right, it is a joke.
I can't believe there weren't more people there.
Did you vote?
It's only a democracy when people actually show up to the polls.
What's wrong with people?
I don't know what this country is going to do!
