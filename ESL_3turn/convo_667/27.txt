Well people just don't feel like their vote matters anymore.
Well if people would get out and vote it might have been different.
I know, we should all be more concerned with voting.
You are right, it is a joke.
I can't believe there weren't more people there.
Did you vote?
What's wrong with people?
I don't know what this country is going to do!
