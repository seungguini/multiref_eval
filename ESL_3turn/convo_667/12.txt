Well people just don't feel like their vote matters anymore.
Well if people would get out and vote it might have been different.
I'm completely serious.
I know, we should all be more concerned with voting.
Did you vote?
It's only a democracy when people actually show up to the polls.
How could people not turn out?
I don't know what this country is going to do!
