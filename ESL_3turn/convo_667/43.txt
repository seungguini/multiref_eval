Well people just don't feel like their vote matters anymore.
I'm completely serious.
I know, we should all be more concerned with voting.
I can't believe there weren't more people there.
I know, it's crazy!
How could people not turn out?
What's wrong with people?
I don't know what this country is going to do!
