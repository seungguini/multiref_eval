Well people just don't feel like their vote matters anymore.
Well if people would get out and vote it might have been different.
I'm completely serious.
I can't believe there weren't more people there.
Did you vote?
I know, it's crazy!
It's only a democracy when people actually show up to the polls.
I don't know what this country is going to do!
