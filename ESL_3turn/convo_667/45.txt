Well if people would get out and vote it might have been different.
I'm completely serious.
This is what happens when no one votes.
You are right, it is a joke.
It's only a democracy when people actually show up to the polls.
How could people not turn out?
What's wrong with people?
I don't know what this country is going to do!
