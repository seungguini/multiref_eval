Well people just don't feel like their vote matters anymore.
Well if people would get out and vote it might have been different.
I'm completely serious.
This is what happens when no one votes.
I know, we should all be more concerned with voting.
You are right, it is a joke.
I can't believe there weren't more people there.
Did you vote?
I know, it's crazy!
It's only a democracy when people actually show up to the polls.
You're right, it is.
How could people not turn out?
What's wrong with people?
I don't know what this country is going to do!
