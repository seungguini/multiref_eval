Well if people would get out and vote it might have been different.
This is what happens when no one votes.
I know, we should all be more concerned with voting.
I can't believe there weren't more people there.
Did you vote?
It's only a democracy when people actually show up to the polls.
You're right, it is.
I don't know what this country is going to do!
