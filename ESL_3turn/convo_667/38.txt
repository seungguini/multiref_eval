Well people just don't feel like their vote matters anymore.
Well if people would get out and vote it might have been different.
I'm completely serious.
This is what happens when no one votes.
I can't believe there weren't more people there.
I know, it's crazy!
How could people not turn out?
What's wrong with people?
