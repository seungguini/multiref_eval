Well people just don't feel like their vote matters anymore.
Well if people would get out and vote it might have been different.
This is what happens when no one votes.
I know, we should all be more concerned with voting.
I know, it's crazy!
It's only a democracy when people actually show up to the polls.
How could people not turn out?
I don't know what this country is going to do!
