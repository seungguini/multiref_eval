Was he smoking?
I wonder if he fell asleep while sleeping in bed.
Did he have a candle lit?
And then what?
Was he cooking something before he fell asleep?
Is he okay?
Was it and electric problem?
Did he leave the stove on?
Wonder if he was cooking something.
Did a mouse chew through wires?
Did he fall asleep with a lit cigarette in his mouth?
Did the man die?
Was anybody hurt?
Did he get out in time?
Did he have fire alarms?
