They're probably no dirtier than any place.
Same goes for your household.
There are germs in your own bathroom.
You should not be using public restrooms, then.
I understand that point of view.
It's not as bad as you think.
I still prefer to hold it and wait to use my own bathroom.
I've been known to drive home just to avoid having to use a public restroom.
