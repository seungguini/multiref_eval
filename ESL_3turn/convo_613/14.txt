I don't think so.
Same goes for your household.
When you have to go, you have to go; germs or not.
You should not be using public restrooms, then.
I understand that point of view.
It's not as bad as you think.
I still prefer to hold it and wait to use my own bathroom.
I have to line the toilet lid with toilet paper when I use a public bathroom.
