They're probably no dirtier than any place.
I don't think so.
Same goes for your household.
There are germs in your own bathroom.
When you have to go, you have to go; germs or not.
I understand that point of view.
I've been known to drive home just to avoid having to use a public restroom.
I have to line the toilet lid with toilet paper when I use a public bathroom.
