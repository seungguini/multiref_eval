Is there an easy way to check?
I guess I will have to put a calendar reminder on my phone.
Wow, I've never checked that until today.
Is this necessary to do all the time?
I hate car maintanence.
I'll have my mechanic do it.
I didn't realize that I had to put air in my tires that often.
I guess that's why mine look flat.
