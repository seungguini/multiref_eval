Do I have to this often?
Is there an easy way to check?
Do I have to do this a lot?
Every two months!  Why so often?
Is this necessary to do all the time?
I hate car maintanence.
Oh, I had no idea I had to put air in my tires that often.
I didn't realize that I had to put air in my tires that often.
