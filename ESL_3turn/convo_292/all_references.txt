Do I have to this often?
Is there an easy way to check?
I'll need to remember that.
I guess I will have to put a calendar reminder on my phone.
Do I have to do this a lot?
Every two months!  Why so often?
Wow, I've never checked that until today.
I didn't realize I had to do it that often.
Is this necessary to do all the time?
I hate car maintanence.
Oh, I had no idea I had to put air in my tires that often.
I'll have my mechanic do it.
I didn't realize that I had to put air in my tires that often.
I guess that's why mine look flat.
