Ha!  I wouldn't push this hell on anyone.
You mean if they don't care about making a lot of money.
That's terrible advice.
I tell my students to follow their dreams.
I hope you're kidding.
I bet they get a kick out of that.
I tell my students they can achieve anything they set their minds to.
Did they laugh in your face?
