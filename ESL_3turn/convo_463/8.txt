Ha!  I wouldn't push this hell on anyone.
You mean if they don't care about making a lot of money.

Oh really?  What do they say?
I tell my students they can achieve anything they set their minds to.
No one is going to take you up on that.
I think being a teacher is a very rewarding profession.
That's an interesting idea.
