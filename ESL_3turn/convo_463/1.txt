You mean if they don't care about making a lot of money.
What do they say in return?
I hope you're kidding.
I bet they get a kick out of that.
I tell my students they can achieve anything they set their minds to.
I think being a teacher is a very rewarding profession.
Did they laugh in your face?
My students would laugh at me if I told them that.
