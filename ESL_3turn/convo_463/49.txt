Ha!  I wouldn't push this hell on anyone.
You mean if they don't care about making a lot of money.
With that job they'll always have work.
I bet they get a kick out of that.
I tell my students they can achieve anything they set their minds to.
No one is going to take you up on that.
I think being a teacher is a very rewarding profession.
My students would laugh at me if I told them that.
