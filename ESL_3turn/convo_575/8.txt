You'll need to leave immediately then if you want to catch your flight.
I'll drive fast, but don't get your hopes up.
Where are you flying to?
I'd make other arrangements.
Does your flight leave at 6 or do you just need to be there by 6?
Are you flying or picking someone up at 6?
You're going to have to rush!
I'll pray for you.
