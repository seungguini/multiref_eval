Good luck, dude.
You'll need to leave immediately then if you want to catch your flight.
Well, good luck.
Good luck!
I'll drive fast, but don't get your hopes up.
Where are you flying to?
I don't think that's going to happen.
I hope you make it!
I'd make other arrangements.
Does your flight leave at 6 or do you just need to be there by 6?
You should have thought of that beforehand.
Is there a later flight you can take?
Are you flying or picking someone up at 6?
You're going to have to rush!
I'll pray for you.
