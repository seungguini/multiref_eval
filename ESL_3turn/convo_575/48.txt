Good luck, dude.
You'll need to leave immediately then if you want to catch your flight.
Good luck!
I'll drive fast, but don't get your hopes up.
Where are you flying to?
Does your flight leave at 6 or do you just need to be there by 6?
Are you flying or picking someone up at 6?
You're going to have to rush!
