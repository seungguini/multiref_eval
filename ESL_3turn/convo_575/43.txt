Good luck, dude.
You'll need to leave immediately then if you want to catch your flight.
I'll drive fast, but don't get your hopes up.
I don't think that's going to happen.
I hope you make it!
Does your flight leave at 6 or do you just need to be there by 6?
Is there a later flight you can take?
Are you flying or picking someone up at 6?
