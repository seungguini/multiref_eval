You'll need to leave immediately then if you want to catch your flight.
Good luck!
I'll drive fast, but don't get your hopes up.
I don't think that's going to happen.
Does your flight leave at 6 or do you just need to be there by 6?
You should have thought of that beforehand.
Is there a later flight you can take?
I'll pray for you.
