Well why haven't you yet?
You should do it, there are a lot of options closer in.
It's likely that moving closer to your job would make your life a lot easier.
Moving was the best thing that I did when my drive was too long.
Think about it.
Just be picky, it's a tough market.
You should move closer to your job.
Is there anything keeping you from moving at the moment?
