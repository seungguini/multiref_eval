Maybe it would be in your best interest to move closer to your job.
Well why haven't you yet?
It might be a good idea.
You should do it, there are a lot of options closer in.
Moving was the best thing that I did when my drive was too long.
Think about it.
Just be picky, it's a tough market.
Is there anything keeping you from moving at the moment?
