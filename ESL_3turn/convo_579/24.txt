Yeah, but he's not really my type if you know what I mean.
I need some time to myself.
He's a good guy, but I'm not ready to date anyone.
I'm too busy for a relationship.
I wasn't feeling it.
There are lots of good men but I'm not planning on dating all of them.
I changed my mind.
He came on too strong.
