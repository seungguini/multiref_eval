Yeah, but he's not really my type if you know what I mean.
It turns out he's still married.
I'm too busy for a relationship.
I don't think he's my type.
I just don't think we'd work out.
I don't want to lead him on since I don't want to date.
There are lots of good men but I'm not planning on dating all of them.
I changed my mind.
