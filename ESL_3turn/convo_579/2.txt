I need some time to myself.
It turns out he's still married.
He's a good guy, but I'm not ready to date anyone.
I don't think he's my type.
I just don't think we'd work out.
I don't want to lead him on since I don't want to date.
I wasn't feeling it.
There are lots of good men but I'm not planning on dating all of them.
