I'm just not feeling it.
Yeah, but he's not really my type if you know what I mean.
I need some time to myself.
He's a good guy, but I'm not ready to date anyone.
I don't think he's my type.
I just don't think we'd work out.
I don't want to lead him on since I don't want to date.
I changed my mind.
