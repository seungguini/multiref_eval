Yeah, but he's not really my type if you know what I mean.
I need some time to myself.
It turns out he's still married.
He's a good guy, but I'm not ready to date anyone.
I'm too busy for a relationship.
I just don't think we'd work out.
I don't want to lead him on since I don't want to date.
He came on too strong.
