I was just going to wear something I already have.
I'll buy it for you if you like it.
Maybe the price-tag will be worth it if it's good quality.
Did you get it?
Really, how much was it?
Don't buy something just for one occasion.
Do you want to go dress shopping together.
What store was the dress at?
