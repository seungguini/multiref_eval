I was just going to wear something I already have.
How much was the dress?
I'll buy it for you if you like it.
Really, where?
You should get it!
Maybe the price-tag will be worth it if it's good quality.
Did you get it?
Really, how much was it?
That's smart.
I'm sure it looked amazing on you though!
Don't buy something just for one occasion.
What did it look like?
Do you want to go dress shopping together.
What store was the dress at?
Did you buy anything else?
No one will really care what we wear.
Do you want to go shopping.
