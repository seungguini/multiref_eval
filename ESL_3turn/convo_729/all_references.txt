Maybe there was an emergency.
She is a bit of a pill.
She's just one girl!
Well, maybe she was busy.
Did you talk to her?
Don't you know that she got back together with Duncan?
There are other girls.
Did she say why?
Not all girls will be like Sarah.
Don't give up yet!
Did she tell you beforehand?
There are many other girls out there, just keep moving forward.
That's her loss!
Ooof, sounds like she got cold feet.
Forget Sarah! Her loss!
Did you try calling her?
It's probably because she found somebody better.
