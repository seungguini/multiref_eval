I could use another pair though.
Where is it?
Did you already ruin them?
You need another one?
I need a black pair too.
What are you saying then?
Did you not like the way they fit?
Where do you want to go?
We need several pairs of pants for work.
You want more pants?
I need some that are a little dressier.
I see, where is the one you bought?
Yes but those don't match my outfit.
Did you loose the one you just bought?
