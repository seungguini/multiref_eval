Doesn't it always do that?
They are hosting an open house next weekend.
I was thinking about taking some this year.
Really?
What kind of courses?
They break ground on the new building any day now.
Do you know when I can start enrolling?
What classes?
How much do they cost?
How did you find that out?
Anything fun, or just academic?
When do they start?
Anything serious, or just fun stuff?
Are you going to take one?
