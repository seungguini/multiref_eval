How about the pond out back?
I don't care where we go.
I heard the pier by the bay is nice.
What about the place we went to last summer?
Let's go down to the River.
Let's check the facebook group I belong to, they post the best spots each day.
Let's go to our old, secret hideaway.
Wherever they're biting.
