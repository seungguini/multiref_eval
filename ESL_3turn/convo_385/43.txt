Yes, yes I do.
If I want to keep my job I do.
I can't be late again, Rita.
You are right, I should slow down.
Well, yeah. It's better than being a slow driver.
No. I could be late again and get fired I guess.
If I don't get there on time, they'll fire me.
Yes! I've already been late 4 times this week!
