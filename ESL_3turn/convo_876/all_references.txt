Then bring them out and let's go to trial.
I was not at the scene of the crime during the time it happened.
They are lying.
I did not steal from that bank.
If that's true then you shouldn't be afraid of going to trial.
They must be mistaken.
I'm sure they are mistaken.
Your honor, my innocence will be proven in this trial.
When have they had the chance to see my face?
That's not possible.
Could they possibly be mixing me up with someone else?
But I didn't do anything.
I have never seen these people.
That is complete bull.
