I was not at the scene of the crime during the time it happened.
They are lying.
I did not steal from that bank.
If that's true then you shouldn't be afraid of going to trial.
I'm sure they are mistaken.
When have they had the chance to see my face?
That's not possible.
I have never seen these people.
