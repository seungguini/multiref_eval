I was not at the scene of the crime during the time it happened.
They are lying.
I did not steal from that bank.
If that's true then you shouldn't be afraid of going to trial.
I'm sure they are mistaken.
Could they possibly be mixing me up with someone else?
But I didn't do anything.
That is complete bull.
