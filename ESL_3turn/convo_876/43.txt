I was not at the scene of the crime during the time it happened.
They are lying.
I did not steal from that bank.
If that's true then you shouldn't be afraid of going to trial.
Your honor, my innocence will be proven in this trial.
When have they had the chance to see my face?
That's not possible.
That is complete bull.
