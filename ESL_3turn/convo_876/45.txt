I was not at the scene of the crime during the time it happened.
I did not steal from that bank.
They must be mistaken.
Your honor, my innocence will be proven in this trial.
That's not possible.
Could they possibly be mixing me up with someone else?
I have never seen these people.
That is complete bull.
