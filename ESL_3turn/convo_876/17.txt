Then bring them out and let's go to trial.
I was not at the scene of the crime during the time it happened.
They are lying.
I did not steal from that bank.
They must be mistaken.
Your honor, my innocence will be proven in this trial.
When have they had the chance to see my face?
Could they possibly be mixing me up with someone else?
