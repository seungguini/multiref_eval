I was not at the scene of the crime during the time it happened.
If that's true then you shouldn't be afraid of going to trial.
Your honor, my innocence will be proven in this trial.
When have they had the chance to see my face?
That's not possible.
Could they possibly be mixing me up with someone else?
But I didn't do anything.
That is complete bull.
