Then bring them out and let's go to trial.
I was not at the scene of the crime during the time it happened.
They are lying.
I'm sure they are mistaken.
Your honor, my innocence will be proven in this trial.
When have they had the chance to see my face?
But I didn't do anything.
That is complete bull.
