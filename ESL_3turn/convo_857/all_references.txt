IAM NOT DRIVING TOO FAST
Shut it.
Well that's just not possible.
Well I am late.
ITS JUST 80KM/HOURS
Don't ever give me advice.
I'll try to be more careful.
I am always in a hurry.
It's fine.
Don't tell me what to do.
I know I need to slow down.
Dude, I'm perfectly safe.
Would you like to drive then?
Thanks for reminding me.
Says you.
Please don't criticize my driving.
I should have left earlier.
