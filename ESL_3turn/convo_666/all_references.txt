At least you're getting something though.
How much are you going to get?
That sucks!
How much are they giving you?
But something is better than nothing.
What are they going to cover?
Maybe they'll change their mind.
I am sorry to hear that!
Why aren' they covering everything?
Did they make a mistake?
Every little bit helps!
That's crazy!
Is the number final or will you be able to appeal the decision?
Will you be ok?
What are you going to do now?
