Late is late, I don't make the rules.
Doesn't matter. They're still late.
Unfortunately, it is the policy I have to charge you.
Anytime after the cut off is considered late no matter how many minutes.
That is one minute after the return date.
It's not my decision, I have to process the fee.
Wanna make it $10?
The fee is automated, it's out of my control.
