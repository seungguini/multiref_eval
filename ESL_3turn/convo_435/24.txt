I'm sorry but you signed a document agreeing to this fee schedule.
Unfortunately, it is the policy I have to charge you.
Anytime after the cut off is considered late no matter how many minutes.
That is one minute after the return date.
I'll let this one slide.
It's not my decision, I have to process the fee.
The fee is automated, it's out of my control.
There's nothing I can do, it is the rule.
