Late is late, I don't make the rules.
Late is late no matter what time.
I'm sorry but you signed a document agreeing to this fee schedule.
Doesn't matter. They're still late.
Anytime after the cut off is considered late no matter how many minutes.
That is one minute after the return date.
Wanna make it $10?
There's nothing I can do, it is the rule.
