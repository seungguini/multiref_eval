Late is late, I don't make the rules.
Late is late no matter what time.
I'm sorry but you signed a document agreeing to this fee schedule.
Doesn't matter. They're still late.
Unfortunately, it is the policy I have to charge you.
Anytime after the cut off is considered late no matter how many minutes.
It's not my decision, I have to process the fee.
There's nothing I can do, it is the rule.
