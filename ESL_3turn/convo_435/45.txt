Late is late, I don't make the rules.
Doesn't matter. They're still late.
Unfortunately, it is the policy I have to charge you.
Anytime after the cut off is considered late no matter how many minutes.
That is one minute after the return date.
I'll let this one slide.
It's not my decision, I have to process the fee.
Wanna make it $10?
