Late is late, I don't make the rules.
Late is late no matter what time.
I'm sorry but you signed a document agreeing to this fee schedule.
Doesn't matter. They're still late.
Unfortunately, it is the policy I have to charge you.
Wanna make it $10?
The fee is automated, it's out of my control.
There's nothing I can do, it is the rule.
