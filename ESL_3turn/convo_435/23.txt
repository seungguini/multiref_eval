Late is late no matter what time.
I'm sorry but you signed a document agreeing to this fee schedule.
Doesn't matter. They're still late.
Anytime after the cut off is considered late no matter how many minutes.
That is one minute after the return date.
I'll let this one slide.
The fee is automated, it's out of my control.
There's nothing I can do, it is the rule.
