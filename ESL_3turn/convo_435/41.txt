Doesn't matter. They're still late.
Unfortunately, it is the policy I have to charge you.
Anytime after the cut off is considered late no matter how many minutes.
That is one minute after the return date.
I'll let this one slide.
Wanna make it $10?
The fee is automated, it's out of my control.
There's nothing I can do, it is the rule.
