Late is late, I don't make the rules.
Late is late no matter what time.
I'm sorry but you signed a document agreeing to this fee schedule.
Anytime after the cut off is considered late no matter how many minutes.
I'll let this one slide.
It's not my decision, I have to process the fee.
Wanna make it $10?
There's nothing I can do, it is the rule.
