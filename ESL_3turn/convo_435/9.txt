I'm sorry but you signed a document agreeing to this fee schedule.
Doesn't matter. They're still late.
Unfortunately, it is the policy I have to charge you.
I'll let this one slide.
It's not my decision, I have to process the fee.
Wanna make it $10?
The fee is automated, it's out of my control.
There's nothing I can do, it is the rule.
