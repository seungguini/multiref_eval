Late is late, I don't make the rules.
Late is late no matter what time.
Unfortunately, it is the policy I have to charge you.
I'll let this one slide.
It's not my decision, I have to process the fee.
Wanna make it $10?
The fee is automated, it's out of my control.
There's nothing I can do, it is the rule.
