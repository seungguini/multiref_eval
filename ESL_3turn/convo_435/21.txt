Late is late, I don't make the rules.
Late is late no matter what time.
Doesn't matter. They're still late.
Unfortunately, it is the policy I have to charge you.
Anytime after the cut off is considered late no matter how many minutes.
That is one minute after the return date.
Wanna make it $10?
There's nothing I can do, it is the rule.
