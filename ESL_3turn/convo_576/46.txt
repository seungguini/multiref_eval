Well, they come to your neighborhood because people keep feeding them.
Hard to do when we have all this good food.
And your trash should stay in the bin, but that never seems to happen.
Well what do you expect?
I hope one doesn't come by my house.
They've run out of food in the woods.
Tell that to the bears.
It's sad that they have no where else to go.
