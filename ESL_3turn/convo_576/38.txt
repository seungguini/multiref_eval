Well, they come to your neighborhood because people keep feeding them.
And your trash should stay in the bin, but that never seems to happen.
They'll go back to the woods once people stop feeding them.
Yeah, they scare me.
Keep your doors locked.
I hope one doesn't come by my house.
They've run out of food in the woods.
Have you seen one?
