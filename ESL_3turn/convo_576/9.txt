I like seeing them in my yard.
Well, they come to your neighborhood because people keep feeding them.
They'll go back to the woods once people stop feeding them.
Keep your doors locked.
They've run out of food in the woods.
Have you seen one?
Tell that to the bears.
It's sad that they have no where else to go.
