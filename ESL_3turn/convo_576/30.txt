I like seeing them in my yard.
Hard to do when we have all this good food.
And your trash should stay in the bin, but that never seems to happen.
They'll go back to the woods once people stop feeding them.
Yeah, they scare me.
Keep your doors locked.
I hope one doesn't come by my house.
They've run out of food in the woods.
