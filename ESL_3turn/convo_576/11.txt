I like seeing them in my yard.
Well, they come to your neighborhood because people keep feeding them.
And your trash should stay in the bin, but that never seems to happen.
They'll go back to the woods once people stop feeding them.
Well what do you expect?
I hope one doesn't come by my house.
They've run out of food in the woods.
Tell that to the bears.
