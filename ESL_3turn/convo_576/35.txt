Well, they come to your neighborhood because people keep feeding them.
Just don't feed them!
And your trash should stay in the bin, but that never seems to happen.
They'll go back to the woods once people stop feeding them.
Yeah, they scare me.
Well what do you expect?
I hope one doesn't come by my house.
They've run out of food in the woods.
