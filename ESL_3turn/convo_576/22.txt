Well, they come to your neighborhood because people keep feeding them.
Hard to do when we have all this good food.
And your trash should stay in the bin, but that never seems to happen.
They'll go back to the woods once people stop feeding them.
Yeah, they scare me.
Have you seen one?
Tell that to the bears.
It's sad that they have no where else to go.
