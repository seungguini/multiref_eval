Well, they come to your neighborhood because people keep feeding them.
Hard to do when we have all this good food.
They'll go back to the woods once people stop feeding them.
Keep your doors locked.
Well what do you expect?
I hope one doesn't come by my house.
They've run out of food in the woods.
Tell that to the bears.
