I like seeing them in my yard.
Well, they come to your neighborhood because people keep feeding them.
Hard to do when we have all this good food.
Just don't feed them!
And your trash should stay in the bin, but that never seems to happen.
Well what do you expect?
They've run out of food in the woods.
Tell that to the bears.
