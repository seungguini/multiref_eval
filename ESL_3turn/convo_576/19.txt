Well, they come to your neighborhood because people keep feeding them.
Just don't feed them!
And your trash should stay in the bin, but that never seems to happen.
They'll go back to the woods once people stop feeding them.
I hope one doesn't come by my house.
Have you seen one?
Tell that to the bears.
It's sad that they have no where else to go.
