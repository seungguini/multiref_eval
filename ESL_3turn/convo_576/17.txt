I like seeing them in my yard.
And your trash should stay in the bin, but that never seems to happen.
They'll go back to the woods once people stop feeding them.
Yeah, they scare me.
Keep your doors locked.
Well what do you expect?
Tell that to the bears.
It's sad that they have no where else to go.
