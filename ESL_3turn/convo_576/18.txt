Well, they come to your neighborhood because people keep feeding them.
And your trash should stay in the bin, but that never seems to happen.
Yeah, they scare me.
Well what do you expect?
I hope one doesn't come by my house.
They've run out of food in the woods.
Have you seen one?
It's sad that they have no where else to go.
