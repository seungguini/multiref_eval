Well, they come to your neighborhood because people keep feeding them.
And your trash should stay in the bin, but that never seems to happen.
Keep your doors locked.
I hope one doesn't come by my house.
They've run out of food in the woods.
Have you seen one?
Tell that to the bears.
It's sad that they have no where else to go.
