Well, they come to your neighborhood because people keep feeding them.
They'll go back to the woods once people stop feeding them.
Yeah, they scare me.
Keep your doors locked.
I hope one doesn't come by my house.
They've run out of food in the woods.
Tell that to the bears.
It's sad that they have no where else to go.
