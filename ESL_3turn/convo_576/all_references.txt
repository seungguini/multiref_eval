I like seeing them in my yard.
Well, they come to your neighborhood because people keep feeding them.
Hard to do when we have all this good food.
Just don't feed them!
And your trash should stay in the bin, but that never seems to happen.
They'll go back to the woods once people stop feeding them.
Yeah, they scare me.
Keep your doors locked.
Well what do you expect?
I hope one doesn't come by my house.
They've run out of food in the woods.
Have you seen one?
Tell that to the bears.
It's sad that they have no where else to go.
