Well, they come to your neighborhood because people keep feeding them.
Hard to do when we have all this good food.
Just don't feed them!
Yeah, they scare me.
I hope one doesn't come by my house.
They've run out of food in the woods.
Tell that to the bears.
It's sad that they have no where else to go.
