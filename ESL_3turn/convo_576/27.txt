I like seeing them in my yard.
Well, they come to your neighborhood because people keep feeding them.
They'll go back to the woods once people stop feeding them.
Yeah, they scare me.
Keep your doors locked.
I hope one doesn't come by my house.
Tell that to the bears.
It's sad that they have no where else to go.
