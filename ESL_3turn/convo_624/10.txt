You have two dates in one day?
What time is your date with Mary?
It sounds like you're playing Dorothy.
Wow, you are lucky to have so many women admire you.
Are you dating anyone else?
What time are you seeing Mary?
Make sure you don't mix up their names.
You need a date planner to keep track of all your dates.
