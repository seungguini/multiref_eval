I'm tired and I don't want to talk to you.
I've been tired and in pain for the past two weeks.
Well I've had a fever and sore throat.
I have a runny nose that wouldn't stop.
No thanks.
I haven't slept in two weeks.
My through hurts really bad.
I am too stressed out and not eating enough.  I have no energy.
