I'm tired and I don't want to talk to you.
It's just a cold, I'm fine.
Well I've had a fever and sore throat.
I have a runny nose that wouldn't stop.
I've been throwing up for days.
I'll just go to my doctor tomorrow.
I haven't slept in two weeks.
I am too stressed out and not eating enough.  I have no energy.
