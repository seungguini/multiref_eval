IAM HAVING MANY PROBLEM AT MY BODY
I'm tired and I don't want to talk to you.
I think I'll wait to tell the doctor.
I've been tired and in pain for the past two weeks.
LET ME TELL YOUR PROBLEM
It's just a cold, I'm fine.
Well I've had a fever and sore throat.
I have a runny nose that wouldn't stop.
No thanks.
I've been throwing up for days.
i can't sleep at night.
I'll just go to my doctor tomorrow.
I feel quite nauseous and dizzy.
I haven't slept in two weeks.
My through hurts really bad.
I am too stressed out and not eating enough.  I have no energy.
