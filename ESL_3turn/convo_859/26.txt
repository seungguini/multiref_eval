I'm tired and I don't want to talk to you.
Well I've had a fever and sore throat.
I have a runny nose that wouldn't stop.
i can't sleep at night.
I'll just go to my doctor tomorrow.
I haven't slept in two weeks.
My through hurts really bad.
I am too stressed out and not eating enough.  I have no energy.
