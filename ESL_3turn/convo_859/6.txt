I've been tired and in pain for the past two weeks.
Well I've had a fever and sore throat.
I've been throwing up for days.
i can't sleep at night.
I'll just go to my doctor tomorrow.
I feel quite nauseous and dizzy.
My through hurts really bad.
I am too stressed out and not eating enough.  I have no energy.
