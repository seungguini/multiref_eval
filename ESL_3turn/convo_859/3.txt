I think I'll wait to tell the doctor.
I've been tired and in pain for the past two weeks.
LET ME TELL YOUR PROBLEM
Well I've had a fever and sore throat.
I feel quite nauseous and dizzy.
I haven't slept in two weeks.
My through hurts really bad.
I am too stressed out and not eating enough.  I have no energy.
