I'm tired and I don't want to talk to you.
I've been tired and in pain for the past two weeks.
LET ME TELL YOUR PROBLEM
It's just a cold, I'm fine.
I have a runny nose that wouldn't stop.
I've been throwing up for days.
I feel quite nauseous and dizzy.
I am too stressed out and not eating enough.  I have no energy.
