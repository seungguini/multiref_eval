Just over a year.  I am still meeting new people all the time.
I've been here for 20 years.
Since the beginning of time.
That's great.  How do you like it here?
We have monthly festivals in the square near the school
I'm just kidding, can I interest you in some knives?
Everyone looks out for one another here.
We have a block club meeting every month to keep acquainted
