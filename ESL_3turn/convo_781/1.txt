Just over a year.  I am still meeting new people all the time.
I've been here for 20 years.
My wife and I moved in just last week period
I'm just kidding, can I interest you in some knives?
About 10 years.
Going on twelve years.
We have a block club meeting every month to keep acquainted
I've lived here for a long time.  I know everyone and everyone's dirty laundry.
