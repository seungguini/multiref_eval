Just over a year.  I am still meeting new people all the time.
Since the beginning of time.
I don't actually live here.
We have monthly festivals in the square near the school
I love the people here. Such a tight community.
Do you have children
I've lived here for a long time.  I know everyone and everyone's dirty laundry.
Let me think about how long it's been.
