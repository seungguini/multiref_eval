Just over a year.  I am still meeting new people all the time.
trash do is wednesday
We have monthly festivals in the square near the school
Only a day or so.
I'm just kidding, can I interest you in some knives?
Everyone looks out for one another here.
About 10 years.
I lived here, like my father, and his father before him.
