if you need any thing just let us know
Just over a year.  I am still meeting new people all the time.
Since the beginning of time.
That's great.  How do you like it here?
We have monthly festivals in the square near the school
Everyone looks out for one another here.
We have a block club meeting every month to keep acquainted
I've lived here for a long time.  I know everyone and everyone's dirty laundry.
