Since the beginning of time.
That's great.  How do you like it here?
My wife and I moved in just last week period
I don't actually live here.
Only a day or so.
Everyone looks out for one another here.
We have a block club meeting every month to keep acquainted
I've lived here for a long time.  I know everyone and everyone's dirty laundry.
