Just over a year.  I am still meeting new people all the time.
I've been here for 20 years.
That's great.  How do you like it here?
My wife and I moved in just last week period
Only a day or so.
We have a block club meeting every month to keep acquainted
I've lived here for a long time.  I know everyone and everyone's dirty laundry.
Let me think about how long it's been.
