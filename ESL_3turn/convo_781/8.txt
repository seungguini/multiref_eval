if you need any thing just let us know
I don't actually live here.
I love the people here. Such a tight community.
Only a day or so.
Everyone looks out for one another here.
About 10 years.
I've lived here for a long time.  I know everyone and everyone's dirty laundry.
I lived here, like my father, and his father before him.
