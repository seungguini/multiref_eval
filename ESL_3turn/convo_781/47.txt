I don't actually live here.
We have monthly festivals in the square near the school
I love the people here. Such a tight community.
Do you have children
Everyone looks out for one another here.
Going on twelve years.
We have a block club meeting every month to keep acquainted
I lived here, like my father, and his father before him.
