trash do is wednesday
My wife and I moved in just last week period
I love the people here. Such a tight community.
Only a day or so.
I'm just kidding, can I interest you in some knives?
Do you have children
We have a block club meeting every month to keep acquainted
I've lived here for a long time.  I know everyone and everyone's dirty laundry.
