trash do is wednesday
My wife and I moved in just last week period
I don't actually live here.
We have monthly festivals in the square near the school
Only a day or so.
Everyone looks out for one another here.
Going on twelve years.
I've lived here for a long time.  I know everyone and everyone's dirty laundry.
