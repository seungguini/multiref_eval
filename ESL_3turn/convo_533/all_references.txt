No, there's no problem.
I don't know how to make macaroni and cheese.
Like i said she only she eats Mac n Cheese.
Nothing, it's just that I don't like mac and cheese.
I have other things to do.
I don't like making macaroni and cheese.
She can make it herself.
I don't know how to cook it.
It's just that I have so much homework.
I feel like making pancakes.
I don't know how to cook.
Why can't she do it herself?
I guess it's easy enough.
I have no macaroni and cheese to cook.
You rely on me too much.
Nothing.
She said she doesn't like my cooking.
