How do you ever expect to make a decent living without education?
You just need to take classes that you enjoy.
What do you think you're going to do for work without a degree?!
You can't get a job without a degree, though.
I disagree with your decision, but I can't make you do anything.
Maybe you haven't found the right program yet.
The point is you getting a good-paying job and moving out of my house.
I know, but you're in it for the degree, not the knowledge.
