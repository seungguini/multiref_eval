You could always use public transit.
That's the way it is in every city.
You must leave at the wrong time of the day.
If you rideshare you can use the carpool lane.
Country driving has no traffic, but it does have curvy roads.
It's not that bad.
Same; it annoys me too.
You should listen to books on tape.
