You could always use public transit.
You must leave at the wrong time of the day.
If you rideshare you can use the carpool lane.
Country driving has no traffic, but it does have curvy roads.
You need to be more relaxed.
You have to worry about all the idiot drivers.
It's not that bad.
It could be much worse.
