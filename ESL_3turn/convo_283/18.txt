You could always use public transit.
That's the way it is in every city.
If you rideshare you can use the carpool lane.
Country driving has no traffic, but it does have curvy roads.
You have to worry about all the idiot drivers.
It's not that bad.
It could be much worse.
Especially during 5 o'clock!
