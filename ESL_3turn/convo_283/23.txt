Maybe you should take the bus instead.
That's the way it is in every city.
You must leave at the wrong time of the day.
Country driving has no traffic, but it does have curvy roads.
You have to worry about all the idiot drivers.
It's not that bad.
Especially during 5 o'clock!
You should listen to books on tape.
