That's the way it is in every city.
You must leave at the wrong time of the day.
If you rideshare you can use the carpool lane.
Country driving has no traffic, but it does have curvy roads.
You need to be more relaxed.
You have to worry about all the idiot drivers.
It's not that bad.
You should listen to books on tape.
