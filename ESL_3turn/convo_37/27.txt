Yeah, having all sorts of different passwords is so hard to keep up with.
Yeah you should never use the same password.
Maybe you need to change all of your passwords again.
Yikes! They always say to use a different password but who can remember all that?
I would report this to your email provider so they can shut down the account.
How did you find out your email was hacked?
That happened to me last year.
Man I'm sorry that's such a pain!
