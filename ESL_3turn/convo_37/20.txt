Maybe you need to change all of your passwords again.
Yikes! They always say to use a different password but who can remember all that?
That stinks, hope you were able to get it all fixed.
I would report this to your email provider so they can shut down the account.
It makes me so nervous opening up new accounts online.
How did you find out your email was hacked?
That happened to me last year.
Did you have any sensitive information in your emails?
