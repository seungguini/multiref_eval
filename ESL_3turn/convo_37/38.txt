Yikes! They always say to use a different password but who can remember all that?
That stinks, hope you were able to get it all fixed.
It makes me so nervous opening up new accounts online.
You need to change your passwords as soon as possible then!
How did you find out your email was hacked?
That happened to me last year.
Do you know if they stole any of your information?
Man I'm sorry that's such a pain!
