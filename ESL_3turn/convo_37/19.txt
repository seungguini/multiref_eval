Yeah, having all sorts of different passwords is so hard to keep up with.
Maybe you need to change all of your passwords again.
That stinks, hope you were able to get it all fixed.
I would report this to your email provider so they can shut down the account.
How did you find out your email was hacked?
That happened to me last year.
Man I'm sorry that's such a pain!
Did you have any sensitive information in your emails?
