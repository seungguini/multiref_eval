Yeah you should never use the same password.
Maybe you need to change all of your passwords again.
Yikes! They always say to use a different password but who can remember all that?

Well I thought that website had better security than that!
I would report this to your email provider so they can shut down the account.

You need to change your passwords as soon as possible then!

Man I'm sorry that's such a pain!
Did you have any sensitive information in your emails?
