Yeah you should never use the same password.
Maybe you need to change all of your passwords again.
Yikes! They always say to use a different password but who can remember all that?
That stinks, hope you were able to get it all fixed.
What kind of website was that?
You need to change your passwords as soon as possible then!
That happened to me last year.
Man I'm sorry that's such a pain!
