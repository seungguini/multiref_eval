Maybe you need to change all of your passwords again.
Yikes! They always say to use a different password but who can remember all that?
Well I thought that website had better security than that!
What kind of website was that?
You need to change your passwords as soon as possible then!
Do you know if they stole any of your information?
Man I'm sorry that's such a pain!
Did you have any sensitive information in your emails?
