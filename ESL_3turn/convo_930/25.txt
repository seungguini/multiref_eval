He did amazing, he won by five points.
I have no idea! That last shot was amazing!
He just keep going.
He did well but did not sign any autographs after.
He's still got it.
There's no telling how much time he spends practicing his swing.
Tiger is back.  He's amazing at the game.
I expected that from him.
