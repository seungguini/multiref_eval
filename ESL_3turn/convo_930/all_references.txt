He did amazing, he won by five points.
I have no idea! That last shot was amazing!
He got lucky.
He just keep going.
He did well but did not sign any autographs after.
He is just incredibly talented.
He's back on top of his game.
He's still got it.
There's no telling how much time he spends practicing his swing.
He dominated from the beginning.
He proves that age is just a number.
Tiger is back.  He's amazing at the game.
I expected that from him.
