He did amazing, he won by five points.
I have no idea! That last shot was amazing!
He did well but did not sign any autographs after.
He's back on top of his game.
There's no telling how much time he spends practicing his swing.
He dominated from the beginning.
He proves that age is just a number.
I expected that from him.
