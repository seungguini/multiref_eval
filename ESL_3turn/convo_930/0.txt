I have no idea! That last shot was amazing!
He just keep going.
He did well but did not sign any autographs after.
He's back on top of his game.
There's no telling how much time he spends practicing his swing.
He proves that age is just a number.
Tiger is back.  He's amazing at the game.
I expected that from him.
