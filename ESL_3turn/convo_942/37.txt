Did it stop working?
Have you tried upgrading the RAM and getting a solid state drive?  It may make it run faster.
Do you want to go shop for one now?
What brands are you looking at?
What kind did you have in mind?
Was it a desktop or laptop?
How much cash do you have towards a new one?
What does that have to do with anything?  If it still works, use it.
