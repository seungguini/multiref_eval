If you buy an Apple, six years is nothing.
Did it stop working?
Does it still work?
Are you looking to upgrade to a newer computer?
Was it a desktop or laptop?
How much cash do you have towards a new one?
Have you ever had an Apple?
What does that have to do with anything?  If it still works, use it.
