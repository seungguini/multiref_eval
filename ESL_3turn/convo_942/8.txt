If you buy an Apple, six years is nothing.
Did it stop working?
Have you tried upgrading the RAM and getting a solid state drive?  It may make it run faster.
Do you want to go shop for one now?
What brands are you looking at?
Are you looking to upgrade to a newer computer?
So is mine, what kind are you thinking of getting?
Was it a desktop or laptop?
