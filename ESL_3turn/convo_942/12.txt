If you buy an Apple, six years is nothing.
Did it stop working?
Do you want to go shop for one now?
What brands are you looking at?
Are you looking to upgrade to a newer computer?
What kind did you have in mind?
Are you going to get another PC or a Mac this time?
What does that have to do with anything?  If it still works, use it.
