Does it still work?
Have you tried upgrading the RAM and getting a solid state drive?  It may make it run faster.
What brands are you looking at?
So is mine, what kind are you thinking of getting?
Are you going to get another PC or a Mac this time?
Have you ever had an Apple?
Have you considered refurbished?
What does that have to do with anything?  If it still works, use it.
