If you buy an Apple, six years is nothing.
Do you want to go shop for one now?
What brands are you looking at?
What kind did you have in mind?
How much cash do you have towards a new one?
Have you ever had an Apple?
Have you considered refurbished?
What does that have to do with anything?  If it still works, use it.
