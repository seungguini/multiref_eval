Does it still work?
Have you tried upgrading the RAM and getting a solid state drive?  It may make it run faster.
What brands are you looking at?
Are you looking to upgrade to a newer computer?
What kind did you have in mind?
Are you going to get another PC or a Mac this time?
Have you ever had an Apple?
What does that have to do with anything?  If it still works, use it.
