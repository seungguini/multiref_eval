If you buy an Apple, six years is nothing.
Did it stop working?
What brands are you looking at?
Are you looking to upgrade to a newer computer?
So is mine, what kind are you thinking of getting?
What kind did you have in mind?
Have you considered refurbished?
What does that have to do with anything?  If it still works, use it.
