If you buy an Apple, six years is nothing.
Did it stop working?
Does it still work?
Have you tried upgrading the RAM and getting a solid state drive?  It may make it run faster.
What brands are you looking at?
So is mine, what kind are you thinking of getting?
Have you ever had an Apple?
What does that have to do with anything?  If it still works, use it.
