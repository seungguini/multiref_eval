If you buy an Apple, six years is nothing.
Did it stop working?
Does it still work?
Have you tried upgrading the RAM and getting a solid state drive?  It may make it run faster.
Are you looking to upgrade to a newer computer?
So is mine, what kind are you thinking of getting?
Have you ever had an Apple?
Have you considered refurbished?
