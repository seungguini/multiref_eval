If you buy an Apple, six years is nothing.
Do you want to go shop for one now?
What brands are you looking at?
Are you looking to upgrade to a newer computer?
Are you going to get another PC or a Mac this time?
How much cash do you have towards a new one?
Have you ever had an Apple?
Have you considered refurbished?
