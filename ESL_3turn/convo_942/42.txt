If you buy an Apple, six years is nothing.
Did it stop working?
So is mine, what kind are you thinking of getting?
What kind did you have in mind?
Are you going to get another PC or a Mac this time?
How much cash do you have towards a new one?
Have you considered refurbished?
What does that have to do with anything?  If it still works, use it.
