If you buy an Apple, six years is nothing.
Does it still work?
Have you tried upgrading the RAM and getting a solid state drive?  It may make it run faster.
So is mine, what kind are you thinking of getting?
Was it a desktop or laptop?
Are you going to get another PC or a Mac this time?
How much cash do you have towards a new one?
Have you ever had an Apple?
