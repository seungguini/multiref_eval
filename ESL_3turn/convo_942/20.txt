If you buy an Apple, six years is nothing.
Did it stop working?
What brands are you looking at?
So is mine, what kind are you thinking of getting?
What kind did you have in mind?
Are you going to get another PC or a Mac this time?
Have you ever had an Apple?
What does that have to do with anything?  If it still works, use it.
