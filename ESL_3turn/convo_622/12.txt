I have always had bad things happen to me on Friday the thirteenth.
I've always found it to be good luck.
I've never believed in superstitions.
I hope I don't see any black cats.
Maybe we should stay in to avoid any bad luck.
I'm already unlucky enough as it is.
How did it get the reputation of being unlucky?
Have you ever had any bad luck on a Friday the thirteenth?
