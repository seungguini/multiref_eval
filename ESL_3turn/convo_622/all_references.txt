I have always had bad things happen to me on Friday the thirteenth.
I've always found it to be good luck.
I've never believed in superstitions.
I hope I don't see any black cats.
Maybe I should change my mindset and think of it as a good day.
Maybe we should stay in to avoid any bad luck.
I'm already unlucky enough as it is.
Just make sure you don't walk under any ladders.
How did it get the reputation of being unlucky?
Have you ever had any bad luck on a Friday the thirteenth?
