Then don't tell facebook you birthday.
Then don't put the information in.
It's also so people can check to see what day your birthday is.
Because they use it for advertisement targeting.
Then don't make a Facebook account.
It's so they can target ads at you better too.
Facebook is nosey.
I think you can make it private so not everyone can see it if you are concerned.
