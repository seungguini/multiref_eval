But it can also remind people to wish you a happy birthday.
Then don't tell facebook you birthday.
Then don't put the information in.
Facebook doesn't know that.
Maybe a stalker wants to use that info to make your astrology chart.
Just put it in.
Facebook is nosey.
I think you can make it private so not everyone can see it if you are concerned.
