But it can also remind people to wish you a happy birthday.
Then don't tell facebook you birthday.
Then don't put the information in.
It's also so people can check to see what day your birthday is.
As we get older it's possible to forget though.
Because they use it for advertisement targeting.
Then don't make a Facebook account.

Facebook doesn't know that.
Maybe a stalker wants to use that info to make your astrology chart.
Just put it in.
It's basic information for your profile.
Facebook is nosey.
I think you can make it private so not everyone can see it if you are concerned.
