Then don't tell facebook you birthday.
It's also so people can check to see what day your birthday is.
As we get older it's possible to forget though.
Then don't make a Facebook account.
Facebook doesn't know that.
Just put it in.
Facebook is nosey.
I think you can make it private so not everyone can see it if you are concerned.
