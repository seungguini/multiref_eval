Then don't tell facebook you birthday.
It's also so people can check to see what day your birthday is.
As we get older it's possible to forget though.
Because they use it for advertisement targeting.
It's so they can target ads at you better too.
Facebook doesn't know that.
Facebook is nosey.
I think you can make it private so not everyone can see it if you are concerned.
