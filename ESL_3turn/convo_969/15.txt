I'm in the mood for that.
That's a great idea! There is a new Greek restaurant down the street.
I wish! I don't have any extra money to eat out.
Only if you're treating.
I'm so happy! It's been a long time since we have gone to new restaurant.
Ok, as long as I can get some green food.
What kind of restaurant is it?
I'm starving so let's do it.
