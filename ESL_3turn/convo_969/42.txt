Ok. Let's hit the soup and salad place.
I'm in the mood for that.
Okay, sounds good.
I wish! I don't have any extra money to eat out.
I'm so happy! It's been a long time since we have gone to new restaurant.
Ok, as long as I can get some green food.
I'm definitely in the mood for an evening out.
I'm starving so let's do it.
