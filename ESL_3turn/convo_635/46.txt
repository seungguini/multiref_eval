What happened?
Did you get fired?
Did you quit your other job?
Yes, because I missed an entire day's worth of work.
What are you doing for money?
Were you fired or something?
Are you going to tell me the story or do I have to drag it out of you?
You know they had lots of openings at the new Whole Foods store last week.
