Can you see?
Sounds like you need a stronger bulb.
Why can't you read?
Has your vision gone bad?
Did you lose your book?
Maybe go to another room.
Is it boring?
Do you need to get reading glasses?
Angle the light more toward you.
You should get your vision checked.
I don't know how to help you.
Maybe the light is too dim.
What do you mean?
