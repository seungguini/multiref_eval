I registered at the post office.
Go to your county office to register.
You can call or go online just ask information for  or search for voter registration.
You can do it at most post offices and municipal buildings.
Don't worry about it, your vote doesn't matter.
I went online and looked at how to register in my state.
I went to city hall.
Let me call my brother, he would know.
