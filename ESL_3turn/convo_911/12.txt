I registered at the post office.
You can call or go online just ask information for  or search for voter registration.
I mailed in an application.
You can do it at most post offices and municipal buildings.
Don't worry about it, your vote doesn't matter.
Let me call my sister, she would know.
I went to city hall.
Let me call my brother, he would know.
