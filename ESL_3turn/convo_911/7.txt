I registered at the post office.
Go to your county office to register.
You can call or go online just ask information for  or search for voter registration.
Don't worry about it, your vote doesn't matter.
I filled out a form at a registration booth.
I went online and looked at how to register in my state.
Let me call my sister, she would know.
Let me call my brother, he would know.
