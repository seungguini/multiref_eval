I let Alice borrow it for the weekend.
Pay attention next time.
Alice will give it back to me once she's back from San Francisco.
We'll get you a car after you graduate.
I know you've talked to me about not letting anyone borrow my car.
If you can make the half the money for a car, we'll pay the rest.
I promise I won't do it again.
Do you think that we didn't know that?
