what does that have to do with it
I let Alice borrow it for the weekend.
Pay attention next time.
you may have one soon
Alice will give it back to me once she's back from San Francisco.
She really needed it for her trip.  She's visiting schools.
I promise I won't do it again.
You won't be driving while you live my house, young man.
