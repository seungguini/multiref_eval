what does that have to do with it
I let Alice borrow it for the weekend.
Pay attention next time.
Alice will give it back to me once she's back from San Francisco.
We could tell at the time.
Well you better start paying attention.
She really needed it for her trip.  She's visiting schools.
If you can make the half the money for a car, we'll pay the rest.
