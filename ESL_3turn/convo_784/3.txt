what does that have to do with it
I let Alice borrow it for the weekend.
Pay attention next time.
Alice will give it back to me once she's back from San Francisco.
I know you've talked to me about not letting anyone borrow my car.
She really needed it for her trip.  She's visiting schools.
And who is to blame for that?
You won't be driving while you live my house, young man.
