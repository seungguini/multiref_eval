Bacon and chocolate? No I've never heard of that!
Yeah, my mom already told me that.
That sounds absolutely gross.
But, have you tried it in ice cream?
That sounds like something I'd love!
Not yet, but i sure will!
I guess I would try it, but I don't think I would like the combination.
That sounds really healthy, not.
