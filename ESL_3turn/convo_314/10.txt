Seriously? I never heard of it!
I did know that.
Bacon and chocolate? No I've never heard of that!
Yes, it may just be the perfect food!
But, have you tried it in ice cream?
Not yet, but i sure will!
I guess I would try it, but I don't think I would like the combination.
What a great friend you are.
