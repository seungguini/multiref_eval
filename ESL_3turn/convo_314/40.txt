I did know that.
Bacon and chocolate? No I've never heard of that!
Yeah, my mom already told me that.
Yes, it may just be the perfect food!
But, have you tried it in ice cream?
That sounds like something I'd love!
I guess I would try it, but I don't think I would like the combination.
What a great friend you are.
