I did know that.
Bacon and chocolate? No I've never heard of that!
Yes and it is very tasty!
That sounds absolutely gross.
But, have you tried it in ice cream?
That sounds like something I'd love!
I guess I would try it, but I don't think I would like the combination.
That sounds really healthy, not.
