Really? How do you do that?
Seriously? I never heard of it!
I did know that.
Bacon and chocolate? No I've never heard of that!
Yes, it may just be the perfect food!
But, have you tried it in ice cream?
I guess I would try it, but I don't think I would like the combination.
What a great friend you are.
