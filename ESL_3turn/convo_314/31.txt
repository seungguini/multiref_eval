Really? How do you do that?
Seriously? I never heard of it!
I did know that.
Bacon and chocolate? No I've never heard of that!
Yes, it may just be the perfect food!
That sounds absolutely gross.
But, have you tried it in ice cream?
I guess I would try it, but I don't think I would like the combination.
