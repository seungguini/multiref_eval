Seriously? I never heard of it!
Bacon and chocolate? No I've never heard of that!
Yes and it is very tasty!
Yes, it may just be the perfect food!
That sounds absolutely gross.
But, have you tried it in ice cream?
Not yet, but i sure will!
I guess I would try it, but I don't think I would like the combination.
