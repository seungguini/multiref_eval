Really? How do you do that?
Seriously? I never heard of it!
I did know that.
Bacon and chocolate? No I've never heard of that!
Yes and it is very tasty!
Yeah, my mom already told me that.
Yes, it may just be the perfect food!
That sounds absolutely gross.
But, have you tried it in ice cream?
That sounds like something I'd love!
Not yet, but i sure will!
I guess I would try it, but I don't think I would like the combination.
What a great friend you are.
That sounds really healthy, not.
