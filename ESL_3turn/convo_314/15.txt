Seriously? I never heard of it!
Bacon and chocolate? No I've never heard of that!
Yeah, my mom already told me that.
That sounds absolutely gross.
But, have you tried it in ice cream?
Not yet, but i sure will!
I guess I would try it, but I don't think I would like the combination.
What a great friend you are.
