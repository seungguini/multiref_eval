I am worried about you taking too many classes.
Yeah but won't you feel overworked?
Good luck then.
Don't over work yourself!
I think you should wait until next term to take Psychology 101.
You're gonna so tired and overworked dude.
Well, you're gonna have a really busy week.
I might take that class too.
