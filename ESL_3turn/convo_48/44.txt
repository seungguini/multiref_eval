She's not a very nice girl.
I think she's married.
Because I'm planning to ask her out and I don't want you to make it complicated.
I am pretty sure she only dates women.
She works too much and never has time to go on dates.
I don't think you're her type.
She is moving to Washington next week!
Because I am in love with her.
