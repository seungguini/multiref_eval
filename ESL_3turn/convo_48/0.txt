Because she already has a boyfriend.
Because she's the worst. She's so petty and mean.
Because I already did and she said yes.
She's not a very nice girl.
I think she's married.
Because I'm planning to ask her out and I don't want you to make it complicated.
I don't think you're her type.
Because I am in love with her.
