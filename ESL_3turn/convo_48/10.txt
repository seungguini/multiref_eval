Because she's the worst. She's so petty and mean.
Because I already did and she said yes.
She's not a very nice girl.
C'mon, you know she's not in to you.
I am pretty sure she only dates women.
She works too much and never has time to go on dates.
I don't think you're her type.
Because I am in love with her.
