Because she already has a boyfriend.
Because she's the worst. She's so petty and mean.
Because I already did and she said yes.
She's not a very nice girl.
I think she's married.
C'mon, you know she's not in to you.
She works too much and never has time to go on dates.
I don't think you're her type.
