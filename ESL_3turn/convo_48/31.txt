Because she already has a boyfriend.
Because she's the worst. She's so petty and mean.
Because I'm planning to ask her out and I don't want you to make it complicated.
She uses guys.
I am pretty sure she only dates women.
She works too much and never has time to go on dates.
She is moving to Washington next week!
Because I am in love with her.
