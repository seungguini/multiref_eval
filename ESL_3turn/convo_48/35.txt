Because she already has a boyfriend.
Because she's the worst. She's so petty and mean.
Because I already did and she said yes.
She's not a very nice girl.
C'mon, you know she's not in to you.
Because I'm planning to ask her out and I don't want you to make it complicated.
I don't think you're her type.
She is moving to Washington next week!
