Because she's the worst. She's so petty and mean.
She's not a very nice girl.
I think she's married.
C'mon, you know she's not in to you.
Because I'm planning to ask her out and I don't want you to make it complicated.
She uses guys.
She works too much and never has time to go on dates.
She is moving to Washington next week!
