Because she already has a boyfriend.
Because I already did and she said yes.
I think she's married.
Because I'm planning to ask her out and I don't want you to make it complicated.
She uses guys.
I am pretty sure she only dates women.
I don't think you're her type.
She is moving to Washington next week!
