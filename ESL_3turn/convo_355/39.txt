I agree.
I think you are right.
I wonder what causes it.
It's probably the bad perfume they wear.
I think it's because she's had the same rug and sofa for years.
Since there is a baby smell, I guess it's possible to also have an old person smell.
I wish I could do something about it.
It's very strong.
