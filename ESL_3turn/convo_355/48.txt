I wonder what causes it.
It's probably the bad perfume they wear.
I think it's because she's had the same rug and sofa for years.
It makes me feel sick to my stomach.
I don't like the smell of the potpourri they have out.
I think she's do for a full apartment cleaning.
I wish I could do something about it.
She can't smell it.
