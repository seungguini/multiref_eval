I agree.
I think it's because she's had the same rug and sofa for years.
It makes me feel sick to my stomach.
Since there is a baby smell, I guess it's possible to also have an old person smell.
I think she's do for a full apartment cleaning.
I wish I could do something about it.
She can't smell it.
It's very strong.
