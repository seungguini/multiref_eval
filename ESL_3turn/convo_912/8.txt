I wonder how many creatures live there that we've never discovered.
Do you know how deep it is?
We need to keep it clean from plastic and pollution.
How long do you think it would take to cross?
The best sunsets are over the ocean.
How far do you think we can see?
How deep do you think it is?
The ocean is full of fish.
