The Pacific Ocean is the largest.
I wonder how many creatures live there that we've never discovered.
Do you know how deep it is?
Have you ever tried swimming in the ocean?
How long do you think it would take to cross?
The best sunsets are over the ocean.
There are tons of life in the ocean.
The ocean is full of fish.
