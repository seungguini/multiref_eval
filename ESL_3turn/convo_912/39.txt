The Pacific Ocean is the largest.
I wonder how many creatures live there that we've never discovered.
Do you know how deep it is?
I wonder how many fish are under there.
How long do you think it would take to cross?
The best sunsets are over the ocean.
How far do you think we can see?
The ocean is full of fish.
