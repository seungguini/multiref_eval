The Pacific Ocean is the largest.
I wonder how many creatures live there that we've never discovered.
Do you know how deep it is?
No there are at least two shores for every ocean.
I wonder how many fish are under there.
We need to keep it clean from plastic and pollution.
How far do you think we can see?
The ocean is full of fish.
