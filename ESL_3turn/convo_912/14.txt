Well not forever but certainly for as long as the eye can see.
The Pacific Ocean is the largest.
I wonder how many creatures live there that we've never discovered.
No there are at least two shores for every ocean.
How long do you think it would take to cross?
How far do you think we can see?
There are tons of life in the ocean.
How deep do you think it is?
