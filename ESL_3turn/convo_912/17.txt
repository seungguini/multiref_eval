Well not forever but certainly for as long as the eye can see.
No there are at least two shores for every ocean.
I wonder how many fish are under there.
How long do you think it would take to cross?
The best sunsets are over the ocean.
There are tons of life in the ocean.
How deep do you think it is?
The ocean is full of fish.
