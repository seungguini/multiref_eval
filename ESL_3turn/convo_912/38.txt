I wonder how many creatures live there that we've never discovered.
Do you know how deep it is?
I wonder how many fish are under there.
We need to keep it clean from plastic and pollution.
Have you ever tried swimming in the ocean?
The best sunsets are over the ocean.
There are tons of life in the ocean.
The ocean is full of fish.
