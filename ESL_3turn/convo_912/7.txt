Well not forever but certainly for as long as the eye can see.
I wonder how many creatures live there that we've never discovered.
No there are at least two shores for every ocean.
I wonder how many fish are under there.
Have you ever tried swimming in the ocean?
How far do you think we can see?
How deep do you think it is?
The ocean is full of fish.
