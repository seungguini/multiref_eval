Well not forever but certainly for as long as the eye can see.
The Pacific Ocean is the largest.
Do you know how deep it is?
We need to keep it clean from plastic and pollution.
How long do you think it would take to cross?
The best sunsets are over the ocean.
How far do you think we can see?
How deep do you think it is?
