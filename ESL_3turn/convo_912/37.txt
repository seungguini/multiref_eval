Well not forever but certainly for as long as the eye can see.
I wonder how many creatures live there that we've never discovered.
Do you know how deep it is?
I wonder how many fish are under there.
Have you ever tried swimming in the ocean?
How long do you think it would take to cross?
How deep do you think it is?
The ocean is full of fish.
