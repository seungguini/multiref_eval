Well not forever but certainly for as long as the eye can see.
The Pacific Ocean is the largest.
Do you know how deep it is?
No there are at least two shores for every ocean.
I wonder how many fish are under there.
The best sunsets are over the ocean.
There are tons of life in the ocean.
How deep do you think it is?
