The Pacific Ocean is the largest.
I wonder how many creatures live there that we've never discovered.
I wonder how many fish are under there.
We need to keep it clean from plastic and pollution.
The best sunsets are over the ocean.
How far do you think we can see?
There are tons of life in the ocean.
The ocean is full of fish.
