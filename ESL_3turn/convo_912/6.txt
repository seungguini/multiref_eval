Well not forever but certainly for as long as the eye can see.
The Pacific Ocean is the largest.
I wonder how many creatures live there that we've never discovered.
Do you know how deep it is?
How long do you think it would take to cross?
There are tons of life in the ocean.
How deep do you think it is?
The ocean is full of fish.
