Well not forever but certainly for as long as the eye can see.
I wonder how many creatures live there that we've never discovered.
Have you ever tried swimming in the ocean?
How long do you think it would take to cross?
The best sunsets are over the ocean.
There are tons of life in the ocean.
How deep do you think it is?
The ocean is full of fish.
