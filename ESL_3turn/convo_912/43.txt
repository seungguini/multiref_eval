The Pacific Ocean is the largest.
I wonder how many creatures live there that we've never discovered.
Do you know how deep it is?
No there are at least two shores for every ocean.
Have you ever tried swimming in the ocean?
The best sunsets are over the ocean.
How far do you think we can see?
The ocean is full of fish.
