Do you know how deep it is?
No there are at least two shores for every ocean.
I wonder how many fish are under there.
Have you ever tried swimming in the ocean?
How long do you think it would take to cross?
The best sunsets are over the ocean.
How far do you think we can see?
The ocean is full of fish.
