Well not forever but certainly for as long as the eye can see.
The Pacific Ocean is the largest.
I wonder how many creatures live there that we've never discovered.
Have you ever tried swimming in the ocean?
The best sunsets are over the ocean.
How far do you think we can see?
There are tons of life in the ocean.
The ocean is full of fish.
