Well not forever but certainly for as long as the eye can see.
The Pacific Ocean is the largest.
I wonder how many creatures live there that we've never discovered.
I wonder how many fish are under there.
The best sunsets are over the ocean.
How far do you think we can see?
How deep do you think it is?
The ocean is full of fish.
