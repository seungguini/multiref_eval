Do you know how deep it is?
No there are at least two shores for every ocean.
I wonder how many fish are under there.
How long do you think it would take to cross?
The best sunsets are over the ocean.
How far do you think we can see?
There are tons of life in the ocean.
How deep do you think it is?
