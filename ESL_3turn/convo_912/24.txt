Well not forever but certainly for as long as the eye can see.
The Pacific Ocean is the largest.
I wonder how many creatures live there that we've never discovered.
Have you ever tried swimming in the ocean?
How long do you think it would take to cross?
How far do you think we can see?
How deep do you think it is?
The ocean is full of fish.
