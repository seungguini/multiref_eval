I'd like the chicken salad.
I'll take a burger please.
A burger and fries with a shake to go.
I'd like the sirloin.
I've changed my mind. I won't be ordering. This table is filthy.
Just a shake.
A few things.  A shake. Two double double and three orders of fries.
I want that salad with extra tomatoes.
