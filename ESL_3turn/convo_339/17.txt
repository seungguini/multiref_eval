I'd like the chicken salad.
A large diet coke.
A burger and fries with a shake to go.
I've changed my mind. I won't be ordering. This table is filthy.
Just a shake.
A few things.  A shake. Two double double and three orders of fries.
I want that salad with extra tomatoes.
The arugula salad with a cup of water.
