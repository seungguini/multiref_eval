My alarm keeps messing up.
I just have a problem being on time.
I've been getting a poor sleep every night.
My watch always says I'm on time.
I haven't been sleeping well lately, which makes me wake up late.
My alarm doesn't ever wake me up!
My alarm hasn't been waking up in the mornings for some reason.
There has been construction on the route that I take to get to work.
