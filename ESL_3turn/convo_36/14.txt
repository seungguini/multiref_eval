I think you are lucky I manage to come in at all.
My watch always says I'm on time.
I haven't been sleeping well lately, which makes me wake up late.
I have to depend on public transportation and the buses are always running behind schedule.
My alarm doesn't ever wake me up!
My alarm hasn't been waking up in the mornings for some reason.
I always get stuck in traffic on the way here.
I haven't been feeling well lately, so I keep sleeping in on accident.
