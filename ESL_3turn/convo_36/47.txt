My alarm keeps messing up.
I've been getting a poor sleep every night.
I haven't been sleeping well lately, which makes me wake up late.
My alarm doesn't ever wake me up!
I always get stuck in traffic on the way here.
There has been construction on the route that I take to get to work.
My wife brings me and she's always late.
I haven't been feeling well lately, so I keep sleeping in on accident.
