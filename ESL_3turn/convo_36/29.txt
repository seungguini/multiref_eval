My alarm keeps messing up.
I just have a problem being on time.
I think you are lucky I manage to come in at all.
I need a new alarm clock that works.
I haven't been sleeping well lately, which makes me wake up late.
My alarm doesn't ever wake me up!
I always get stuck in traffic on the way here.
There has been construction on the route that I take to get to work.
