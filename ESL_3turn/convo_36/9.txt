I've been getting a poor sleep every night.
My watch always says I'm on time.
I have to depend on public transportation and the buses are always running behind schedule.
My alarm hasn't been waking up in the mornings for some reason.
I always get stuck in traffic on the way here.
There has been construction on the route that I take to get to work.
My wife brings me and she's always late.
I haven't been feeling well lately, so I keep sleeping in on accident.
