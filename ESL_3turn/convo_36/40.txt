My alarm keeps messing up.
I just have a problem being on time.
I've been getting a poor sleep every night.
I need a new alarm clock that works.
My alarm doesn't ever wake me up!
I always get stuck in traffic on the way here.
My wife brings me and she's always late.
I haven't been feeling well lately, so I keep sleeping in on accident.
