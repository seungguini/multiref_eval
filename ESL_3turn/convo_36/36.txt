My alarm keeps messing up.
I've been getting a poor sleep every night.
I think you are lucky I manage to come in at all.
I need a new alarm clock that works.
I have to depend on public transportation and the buses are always running behind schedule.
My alarm doesn't ever wake me up!
I always get stuck in traffic on the way here.
My wife brings me and she's always late.
