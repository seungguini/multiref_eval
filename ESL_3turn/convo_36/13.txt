I just have a problem being on time.
I think you are lucky I manage to come in at all.
I need a new alarm clock that works.
I haven't been sleeping well lately, which makes me wake up late.
I have to depend on public transportation and the buses are always running behind schedule.
My alarm hasn't been waking up in the mornings for some reason.
There has been construction on the route that I take to get to work.
I haven't been feeling well lately, so I keep sleeping in on accident.
