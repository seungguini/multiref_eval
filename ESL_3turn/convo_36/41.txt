My alarm keeps messing up.
I just have a problem being on time.
I've been getting a poor sleep every night.
I think you are lucky I manage to come in at all.
I need a new alarm clock that works.
My watch always says I'm on time.
My alarm doesn't ever wake me up!
I always get stuck in traffic on the way here.
