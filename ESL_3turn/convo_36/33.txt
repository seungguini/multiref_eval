My alarm keeps messing up.
I think you are lucky I manage to come in at all.
My watch always says I'm on time.
I haven't been sleeping well lately, which makes me wake up late.
My alarm doesn't ever wake me up!
I always get stuck in traffic on the way here.
There has been construction on the route that I take to get to work.
My wife brings me and she's always late.
