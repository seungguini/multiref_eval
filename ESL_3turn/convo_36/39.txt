My alarm keeps messing up.
I just have a problem being on time.
I've been getting a poor sleep every night.
My watch always says I'm on time.
I have to depend on public transportation and the buses are always running behind schedule.
I always get stuck in traffic on the way here.
There has been construction on the route that I take to get to work.
My wife brings me and she's always late.
