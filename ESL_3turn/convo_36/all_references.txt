My alarm keeps messing up.
I just have a problem being on time.
I've been getting a poor sleep every night.
I think you are lucky I manage to come in at all.
I need a new alarm clock that works.
My watch always says I'm on time.
I haven't been sleeping well lately, which makes me wake up late.
I have to depend on public transportation and the buses are always running behind schedule.
My alarm doesn't ever wake me up!
My alarm hasn't been waking up in the mornings for some reason.
I always get stuck in traffic on the way here.
There has been construction on the route that I take to get to work.
My wife brings me and she's always late.
I haven't been feeling well lately, so I keep sleeping in on accident.
