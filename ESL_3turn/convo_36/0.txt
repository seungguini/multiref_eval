I just have a problem being on time.
I've been getting a poor sleep every night.
I think you are lucky I manage to come in at all.
I need a new alarm clock that works.
My watch always says I'm on time.
My alarm hasn't been waking up in the mornings for some reason.
There has been construction on the route that I take to get to work.
My wife brings me and she's always late.
