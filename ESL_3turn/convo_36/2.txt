My alarm keeps messing up.
I just have a problem being on time.
I've been getting a poor sleep every night.
I think you are lucky I manage to come in at all.
My watch always says I'm on time.
I haven't been sleeping well lately, which makes me wake up late.
My alarm hasn't been waking up in the mornings for some reason.
There has been construction on the route that I take to get to work.
