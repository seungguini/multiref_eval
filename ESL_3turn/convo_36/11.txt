My alarm keeps messing up.
I think you are lucky I manage to come in at all.
I need a new alarm clock that works.
My watch always says I'm on time.
I haven't been sleeping well lately, which makes me wake up late.
My alarm hasn't been waking up in the mornings for some reason.
There has been construction on the route that I take to get to work.
I haven't been feeling well lately, so I keep sleeping in on accident.
