I've been getting a poor sleep every night.
I need a new alarm clock that works.
My watch always says I'm on time.
I haven't been sleeping well lately, which makes me wake up late.
My alarm doesn't ever wake me up!
My alarm hasn't been waking up in the mornings for some reason.
There has been construction on the route that I take to get to work.
My wife brings me and she's always late.
