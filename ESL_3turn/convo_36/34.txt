My alarm keeps messing up.
I've been getting a poor sleep every night.
I need a new alarm clock that works.
I haven't been sleeping well lately, which makes me wake up late.
My alarm doesn't ever wake me up!
My alarm hasn't been waking up in the mornings for some reason.
I always get stuck in traffic on the way here.
I haven't been feeling well lately, so I keep sleeping in on accident.
