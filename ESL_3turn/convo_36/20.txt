My alarm keeps messing up.
I've been getting a poor sleep every night.
My watch always says I'm on time.
I haven't been sleeping well lately, which makes me wake up late.
I have to depend on public transportation and the buses are always running behind schedule.
My alarm doesn't ever wake me up!
There has been construction on the route that I take to get to work.
I haven't been feeling well lately, so I keep sleeping in on accident.
