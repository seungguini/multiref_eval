I just have a problem being on time.
I've been getting a poor sleep every night.
I need a new alarm clock that works.
I have to depend on public transportation and the buses are always running behind schedule.
My alarm doesn't ever wake me up!
My alarm hasn't been waking up in the mornings for some reason.
I always get stuck in traffic on the way here.
My wife brings me and she's always late.
