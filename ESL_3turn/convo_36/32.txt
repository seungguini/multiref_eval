My alarm keeps messing up.
I've been getting a poor sleep every night.
I need a new alarm clock that works.
My watch always says I'm on time.
My alarm doesn't ever wake me up!
My alarm hasn't been waking up in the mornings for some reason.
I always get stuck in traffic on the way here.
There has been construction on the route that I take to get to work.
