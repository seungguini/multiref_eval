That's going to be expensive.
Seriously that's not good!
Are you going to buy one?
I know how to fix that for you, don't pay someone to do it.
You probably just need to buy a new computer.
What harddrives are there?
How long have you had that computer?
I see sorry to hear, i heard they are expensive.
