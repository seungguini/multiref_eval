We are driving to California.
I'm going to New York City.
I don't know. I just need to get out of the city.
My friends are meeting us there and we are going to tour the wineries.
To see my son at college.
I'm visiting my grandma in North Dakota.
Just for a trip out to my country house.
Wherever the road takes me.
