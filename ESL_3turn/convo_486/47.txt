We are driving to California.
I'm going to New York City.
No where in particular.
My friends are meeting us there and we are going to tour the wineries.
I don't know yet, I like to surprise myself.
I'm visiting my grandma in North Dakota.
My girlfriend and I are going to Niagara Falls.
Wherever the road takes me.
