We are driving to California.
No where in particular.
I don't know. I just need to get out of the city.
My friends are meeting us there and we are going to tour the wineries.
I don't know yet, I like to surprise myself.
To see my son at college.
My girlfriend and I are going to Niagara Falls.
Wherever the road takes me.
