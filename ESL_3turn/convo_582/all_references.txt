I started last year with the design.
Several afternoons.
It took me all night.
It took me 4 weeks.
It only took me a couple of nights.
No time at all!
I worked on it for three weeks.
It took many days and nights of hard work.
It took me a couple weeks to get all the material, and then I worked on it every night for a month.
Not that long really.
Longer than you want to know.
