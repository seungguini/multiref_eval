I did not
I don't think that IQ tests are the best way to assess the many different kinds of intelligence there are.
No, I haven't. Have you?
No, but I did take the SAT's.

Yes, but it was a long time ago and I don't remember my score.
I've never thought about taking one before.
No, do you think I should?
