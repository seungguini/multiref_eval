Open it and find out.
Ew gross I hate corned beef.
We can ask someone here if they know what's inside.
How can you tell?
We need to figure it out so we can start cooking dinner.
Maybe there's a label on the bottom of the can.
I have never seen a corned beef can before.
Maybe we can smell it and tell what's inside.
