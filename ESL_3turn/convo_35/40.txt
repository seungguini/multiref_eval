Ew gross I hate corned beef.
Gross - just throw it away.
We can ask someone here if they know what's inside.
How can you tell?
We need to figure it out so we can start cooking dinner.
Maybe there's a label on the bottom of the can.
I have never seen a corned beef can before.
Where did you get the can from?
