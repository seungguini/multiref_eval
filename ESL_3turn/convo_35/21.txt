Ew gross I hate corned beef.
We should open it up and see.
Gross - just throw it away.
We need to figure it out so we can start cooking dinner.
Maybe there's a label on the bottom of the can.
I have never seen a corned beef can before.
Where did you get the can from?
Maybe we can smell it and tell what's inside.
