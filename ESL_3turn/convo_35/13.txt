We should open it up and see.
Smell it and see if it smells like one too.
Yes I agree I think it's corned beef.
How can you tell?
We need to figure it out so we can start cooking dinner.
I have never seen a corned beef can before.
Where did you get the can from?
Maybe we can smell it and tell what's inside.
