Smell it and see if it smells like one too.
Gross - just throw it away.
Yes I agree I think it's corned beef.
We can ask someone here if they know what's inside.
We need to figure it out so we can start cooking dinner.
Maybe there's a label on the bottom of the can.
I have never seen a corned beef can before.
Maybe we can smell it and tell what's inside.
