Ew gross I hate corned beef.
We should open it up and see.
We can ask someone here if they know what's inside.
How can you tell?
We need to figure it out so we can start cooking dinner.
I have never seen a corned beef can before.
Where did you get the can from?
Maybe we can smell it and tell what's inside.
