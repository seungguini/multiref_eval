Open it and find out.
Ew gross I hate corned beef.
We should open it up and see.
Smell it and see if it smells like one too.
We can ask someone here if they know what's inside.
Maybe there's a label on the bottom of the can.
I have never seen a corned beef can before.
Maybe we can smell it and tell what's inside.
