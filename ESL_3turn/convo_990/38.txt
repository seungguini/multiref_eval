Is there any way you could possibly move back?
I heard the new apartments on Main St. have some vacancies.
What don't you like about it?
I should have stayed at my old apartment.
What is is that you don't like about your apartment?
Why do you regret moving?
My old apartment was much nicer.
You will learn to love it.
