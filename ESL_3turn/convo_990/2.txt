Is there any way you could possibly move back?
I heard the new apartments on Main St. have some vacancies.
I should have stayed at my old apartment.
What is is that you don't like about your apartment?
Why do you regret moving?
My old apartment was much nicer.
It just takes time.
You will learn to love it.
