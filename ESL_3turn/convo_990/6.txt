I heard the new apartments on Main St. have some vacancies.
I should have stayed at my old apartment.
What is is that you don't like about your apartment?
Why do you regret moving?
The location is too far away from where I commute to work everyday.
My old apartment was much nicer.
It just takes time.
You will learn to love it.
