Is there any way you could possibly move back?
What don't you like about it?
I should have stayed at my old apartment.
What is is that you don't like about your apartment?
Why do you regret moving?
The location is too far away from where I commute to work everyday.
My old apartment was much nicer.
You will learn to love it.
