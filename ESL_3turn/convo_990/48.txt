Is there any way you could possibly move back?
I heard the new apartments on Main St. have some vacancies.
What is is that you don't like about your apartment?
Why do you regret moving?
The location is too far away from where I commute to work everyday.
My old apartment was much nicer.
It just takes time.
You will learn to love it.
