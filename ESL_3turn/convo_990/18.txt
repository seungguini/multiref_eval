Is there any way you could possibly move back?
I heard the new apartments on Main St. have some vacancies.
What don't you like about it?
What is is that you don't like about your apartment?
The location is too far away from where I commute to work everyday.
My old apartment was much nicer.
You will get used to it.
You will learn to love it.
