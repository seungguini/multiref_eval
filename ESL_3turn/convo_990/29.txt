I heard the new apartments on Main St. have some vacancies.
What don't you like about it?
What is is that you don't like about your apartment?
Why do you regret moving?
The location is too far away from where I commute to work everyday.
My old apartment was much nicer.
It just takes time.
You will learn to love it.
