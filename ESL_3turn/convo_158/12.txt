But can we afford it?
oh good . we can have separate bathrooms
We can have a slumber party
It's way too expensive though.
I love you. I can't wait to move!
we'll have to teach the kids how to clean their own bathrooms
nice . i can convert one of the bathrooms into a chemistry lab
I'll be sleeping all day now
