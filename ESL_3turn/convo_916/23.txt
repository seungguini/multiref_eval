I love Italian food, what time?
I heard they have really good spaghetti!
Eh, Italian. I've had enough of that this week.
That sounds great what time?
I'm not really in the mood for Italian.
Can we go to the Chinese restaurant instead?
Have you been there yet?
My friend just went there and loved it.
