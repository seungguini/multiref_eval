I love Italian food, what time?
I heard they have really good spaghetti!
Eh, Italian. I've had enough of that this week.
Do they have spaghetti on the menu?
That sounds great what time?
I'm not really in the mood for Italian.
Cool! I love Italian.
Can we go to the Chinese restaurant instead?
How about that Thai place instead?
That sounds great.
Have you been there yet?
Did you make a reservation?
My friend just went there and loved it.
Great, let's go now.
