Yes, someone can slip and fall.
I know. That's why I called someone
I know, I had a slip and fall in water last year and broke my hip.
That's why I called for a clean up.
I'll stand here and guard the puddle until help arrives.
You've got that right.
That's true. Don't wanna slip and fall
True indeed
