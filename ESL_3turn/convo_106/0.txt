I think I have to be there 2 hours before flight.
Security is a nightmare these days, so I probably need to get there at least two hours early.
I have to be there by ten.
I need to be there three hours before the plane leaves.
I'm not sure, I'll have to check.
I don't have to check in any luggage, so I think I'll try to get there around 11:00 am.
Okay I can give you a ride.
I'm taking a taxi to the airport, and it will be here soon.
