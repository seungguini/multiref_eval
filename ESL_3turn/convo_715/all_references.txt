No, you look great!
I'm not lying.
No, you look great!
Only a little.
Oh, who hasn't? Look at me!
A little bit but your face still looks the same from the last time we've seen each other.
I'd still hit it.
You're crazy.
It looks good on you.
Our metabolism always goes down.
You just look more healthy.
