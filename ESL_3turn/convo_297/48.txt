I have been a lot of fees lately.
Is there anything we can do to help you avoid those fees?
Let me see if I can waive them for you.
Can you confirm your account number?
If you didn't overdraft all of the time,  you wouldn't get fees.
Are you being charged random or specific fees?
I'm not happy about be charged with a lot of unnecessary fees.
There might be a better account option for you. Would you be interested in exploring your options?
