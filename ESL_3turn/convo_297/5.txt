I have been a lot of fees lately.
I'm moving to a new city.
Do you want to see if we have other options that may help you.
Can you confirm your account number?
I'm moving to another country.
If you didn't overdraft all of the time,  you wouldn't get fees.
I want to be a customer at a bank that is closer to my house.
You can always opt to use one of our ATM's to avoid that.
