I have been a lot of fees lately.
We have a few other options.
I'm moving to a new city.
Do you want to see if we have other options that may help you.
If you didn't overdraft all of the time,  you wouldn't get fees.
You can always opt to use one of our ATM's to avoid that.
I'm not happy about be charged with a lot of unnecessary fees.
There might be a better account option for you. Would you be interested in exploring your options?
