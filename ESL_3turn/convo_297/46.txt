Is there anything we can do to help you avoid those fees?
Let me take a look at your account.
I'm moving to a new city.
Can you confirm your account number?
I'm moving to another country.
If you didn't overdraft all of the time,  you wouldn't get fees.
Are you being charged random or specific fees?
I'm not happy about be charged with a lot of unnecessary fees.
