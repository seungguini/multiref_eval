I have been a lot of fees lately.
We have a few other options.
Let me take a look at your account.
I'm moving to a new city.
Can you confirm your account number?
If you didn't overdraft all of the time,  you wouldn't get fees.
You can always opt to use one of our ATM's to avoid that.
I'm not happy about be charged with a lot of unnecessary fees.
