Is there anything we can do to help you avoid those fees?
Let me take a look at your account.
I'm moving to a new city.
Let me see if I can waive them for you.
Do you want to see if we have other options that may help you.
If you didn't overdraft all of the time,  you wouldn't get fees.
Are you being charged random or specific fees?
I want to be a customer at a bank that is closer to my house.
