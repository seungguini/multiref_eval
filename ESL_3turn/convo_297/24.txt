I have been a lot of fees lately.
We have a few other options.
I'm moving to a new city.
Can you confirm your account number?
Are you being charged random or specific fees?
I want to be a customer at a bank that is closer to my house.
You can always opt to use one of our ATM's to avoid that.
I'm not happy about be charged with a lot of unnecessary fees.
