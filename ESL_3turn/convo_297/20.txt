Is there anything we can do to help you avoid those fees?
Let me take a look at your account.
Can you confirm your account number?
If you didn't overdraft all of the time,  you wouldn't get fees.
I want to be a customer at a bank that is closer to my house.
You can always opt to use one of our ATM's to avoid that.
I'm not happy about be charged with a lot of unnecessary fees.
There might be a better account option for you. Would you be interested in exploring your options?
