I have been a lot of fees lately.
Is there anything we can do to help you avoid those fees?
Let me take a look at your account.
I'm moving to a new city.
I'm moving to another country.
I want to be a customer at a bank that is closer to my house.
You can always opt to use one of our ATM's to avoid that.
I'm not happy about be charged with a lot of unnecessary fees.
