I have been a lot of fees lately.
We have a few other options.
Let me take a look at your account.
I'm moving to a new city.
Do you want to see if we have other options that may help you.
If you didn't overdraft all of the time,  you wouldn't get fees.
Are you being charged random or specific fees?
I'm not happy about be charged with a lot of unnecessary fees.
