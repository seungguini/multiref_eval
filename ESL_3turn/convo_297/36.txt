Is there anything we can do to help you avoid those fees?
We have a few other options.
Let me take a look at your account.
I'm moving to a new city.
Do you want to see if we have other options that may help you.
If you didn't overdraft all of the time,  you wouldn't get fees.
I want to be a customer at a bank that is closer to my house.
You can always opt to use one of our ATM's to avoid that.
