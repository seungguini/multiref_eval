I have been a lot of fees lately.
We have a few other options.
I'm moving to a new city.
Do you want to see if we have other options that may help you.
I'm moving to another country.
If you didn't overdraft all of the time,  you wouldn't get fees.

I'm not happy about be charged with a lot of unnecessary fees.
