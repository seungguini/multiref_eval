I have been a lot of fees lately.
Is there anything we can do to help you avoid those fees?
We have a few other options.
Let me take a look at your account.
I'm moving to a new city.
Let me see if I can waive them for you.
Do you want to see if we have other options that may help you.
Can you confirm your account number?
I'm moving to another country.
If you didn't overdraft all of the time,  you wouldn't get fees.
Are you being charged random or specific fees?
I want to be a customer at a bank that is closer to my house.
You can always opt to use one of our ATM's to avoid that.
I'm not happy about be charged with a lot of unnecessary fees.
There might be a better account option for you. Would you be interested in exploring your options?
