I have been a lot of fees lately.
Is there anything we can do to help you avoid those fees?
I'm moving to a new city.
Do you want to see if we have other options that may help you.
Can you confirm your account number?
I want to be a customer at a bank that is closer to my house.
I'm not happy about be charged with a lot of unnecessary fees.
There might be a better account option for you. Would you be interested in exploring your options?
