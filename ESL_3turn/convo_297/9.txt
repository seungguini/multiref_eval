I have been a lot of fees lately.
Is there anything we can do to help you avoid those fees?
We have a few other options.
Let me see if I can waive them for you.
I'm moving to another country.
If you didn't overdraft all of the time,  you wouldn't get fees.
Are you being charged random or specific fees?
I want to be a customer at a bank that is closer to my house.
