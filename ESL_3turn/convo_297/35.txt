Is there anything we can do to help you avoid those fees?
We have a few other options.
Let me take a look at your account.
I'm moving to a new city.
If you didn't overdraft all of the time,  you wouldn't get fees.
Are you being charged random or specific fees?
You can always opt to use one of our ATM's to avoid that.
There might be a better account option for you. Would you be interested in exploring your options?
