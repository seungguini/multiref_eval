Is there anything we can do to help you avoid those fees?
Let me take a look at your account.
I'm moving to a new city.
Do you want to see if we have other options that may help you.
Can you confirm your account number?
Are you being charged random or specific fees?
I want to be a customer at a bank that is closer to my house.
You can always opt to use one of our ATM's to avoid that.
