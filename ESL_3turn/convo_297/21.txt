Is there anything we can do to help you avoid those fees?
Let me see if I can waive them for you.
Do you want to see if we have other options that may help you.
Can you confirm your account number?
If you didn't overdraft all of the time,  you wouldn't get fees.
I want to be a customer at a bank that is closer to my house.
You can always opt to use one of our ATM's to avoid that.
I'm not happy about be charged with a lot of unnecessary fees.
