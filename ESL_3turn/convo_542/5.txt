Do you like to ski?
I used to when I was younger too.
I love to watch the snowfall; it seems so peaceful.
I like snow, but I hate the cold.
I guess you haven't been around it enough then.
I love looking at it, but I hate shoveling it.
Of course, that's why everyone likes winter.
Snow is quite beautiful.
