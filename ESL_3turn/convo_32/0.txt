Yes, but then there are also the bugs.
It rains a lot in the spring though.
That is true, I like when the weather finally warms up again.
I prefer the fall and winter when the air is crisp and cool.
The weather is warm in the summer too.
I like the fall better than the spring.
I would rather have cold weather.
I like the spring weather too.
