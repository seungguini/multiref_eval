That is true, I like when the weather finally warms up again.
I prefer the fall and winter when the air is crisp and cool.
True, but then my electric bill goes up because of the air conditioning.
I like the warm weather, but there's too many bugs during the spring.
I like the fall better than the spring.
I'm not a fan of springtime, I prefer the weather to be cooler.
That's true, but there's a lot of pollen outside during the spring.
Springtime makes my allergies act up though.
