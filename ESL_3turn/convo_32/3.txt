It rains a lot in the spring though.
That is true, I like when the weather finally warms up again.
The weather is warm in the summer too.
I do not enjoy warm weather.
I like the fall better than the spring.
I'm not a fan of springtime, I prefer the weather to be cooler.
That's true, but there's a lot of pollen outside during the spring.
Springtime makes my allergies act up though.
