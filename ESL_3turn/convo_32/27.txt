It rains a lot in the spring though.
I prefer the fall and winter when the air is crisp and cool.
The weather is warm in the summer too.
I do not enjoy warm weather.
I would rather have cold weather.
That's true, but there's a lot of pollen outside during the spring.
I like the spring weather too.
Springtime makes my allergies act up though.
