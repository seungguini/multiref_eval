That is true, I like when the weather finally warms up again.
I prefer the fall and winter when the air is crisp and cool.
I like the warm weather, but there's too many bugs during the spring.
I do not enjoy warm weather.
I like the fall better than the spring.
I'm not a fan of springtime, I prefer the weather to be cooler.
I like the spring weather too.
Springtime makes my allergies act up though.
