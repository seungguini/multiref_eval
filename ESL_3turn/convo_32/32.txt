Yes, but then there are also the bugs.
It rains a lot in the spring though.
The weather is warm in the summer too.
I like the warm weather, but there's too many bugs during the spring.
I like the fall better than the spring.
I'm not a fan of springtime, I prefer the weather to be cooler.
I would rather have cold weather.
That's true, but there's a lot of pollen outside during the spring.
