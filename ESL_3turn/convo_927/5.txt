This girl I met at the bookstore.
I've been going out with Sarah for a couple of week's now.
A very pretty girl.
I went out with Sam, the guy across the hall.
Do you remember Mary in the same class? We got close after the chemistry test.
Someone I met at the bar last week.
A friend from work.
Amy. You remember her from that party last week right?
