This girl I met at the bookstore.
I've been going out with Sarah for a couple of week's now.
Do you remember Mary in the same class? We got close after the chemistry test.
I went out with Kendall, you know, Stephen's little sister.
Someone I met at the bar last week.
I am a lucky guy. I was asked out at the gym. Her name is Suzan. She is sooooo hot.
It wasn't really a date. Six of us went to the movies.
Amy. You remember her from that party last week right?
