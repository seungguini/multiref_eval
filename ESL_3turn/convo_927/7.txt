None of your business.
I will go with Brad Pitt. I wish hahaha.
A very pretty girl.
I went out with Sam, the guy across the hall.
I went out with Kendall, you know, Stephen's little sister.
I am a lucky guy. I was asked out at the gym. Her name is Suzan. She is sooooo hot.
It wasn't really a date. Six of us went to the movies.
A friend from work.
