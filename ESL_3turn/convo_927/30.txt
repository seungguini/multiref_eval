This girl I met at the bookstore.
I've been going out with Sarah for a couple of week's now.
A very pretty girl.
I went out with Sam, the guy across the hall.
Do you remember Mary in the same class? We got close after the chemistry test.
I am a lucky guy. I was asked out at the gym. Her name is Suzan. She is sooooo hot.
Amy. You remember her from that party last week right?
A girl from my Sociology class. I think I'm going to ask her out again.
