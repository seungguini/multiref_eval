This girl I met at the bookstore.
A very pretty girl.
I went out with Sam, the guy across the hall.
Do you remember Mary in the same class? We got close after the chemistry test.
I went out with Kendall, you know, Stephen's little sister.
I am a lucky guy. I was asked out at the gym. Her name is Suzan. She is sooooo hot.
A friend from work.
It was a blind date. Her name was Mallory and she was really fun to be with.
