None of your business.
This girl I met at the bookstore.
I went out with Sam, the guy across the hall.
I went out with Kendall, you know, Stephen's little sister.
I am a lucky guy. I was asked out at the gym. Her name is Suzan. She is sooooo hot.
It wasn't really a date. Six of us went to the movies.
A friend from work.
A girl from my Sociology class. I think I'm going to ask her out again.
