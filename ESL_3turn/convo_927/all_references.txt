I've been going out with Sarah for a couple of week's now.
A very pretty girl.
I went out with Sam, the guy across the hall.

I went out with Kendall, you know, Stephen's little sister.
Someone I met at the bar last week.
I am a lucky guy. I was asked out at the gym. Her name is Suzan. She is sooooo hot.
It wasn't really a date. Six of us went to the movies.
A friend from work.
It was a blind date. Her name was Mallory and she was really fun to be with.
Amy. You remember her from that party last week right?
A girl from my Sociology class. I think I'm going to ask her out again.
