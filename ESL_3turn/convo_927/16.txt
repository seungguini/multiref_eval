None of your business.
I will go with Brad Pitt. I wish hahaha.
I've been going out with Sarah for a couple of week's now.
Do you remember Mary in the same class? We got close after the chemistry test.
I went out with Kendall, you know, Stephen's little sister.
Someone I met at the bar last week.
It wasn't really a date. Six of us went to the movies.
Amy. You remember her from that party last week right?
