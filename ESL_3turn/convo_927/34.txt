None of your business.
This girl I met at the bookstore.
I will go with Brad Pitt. I wish hahaha.
Someone I met at the bar last week.
I am a lucky guy. I was asked out at the gym. Her name is Suzan. She is sooooo hot.
A friend from work.
It was a blind date. Her name was Mallory and she was really fun to be with.
Amy. You remember her from that party last week right?
