None of your business.
This girl I met at the bookstore.
I will go with Brad Pitt. I wish hahaha.
I've been going out with Sarah for a couple of week's now.
A very pretty girl.
Someone I met at the bar last week.
It was a blind date. Her name was Mallory and she was really fun to be with.
Amy. You remember her from that party last week right?
