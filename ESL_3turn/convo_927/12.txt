This girl I met at the bookstore.
A very pretty girl.
I went out with Sam, the guy across the hall.
I went out with Kendall, you know, Stephen's little sister.
Someone I met at the bar last week.
I am a lucky guy. I was asked out at the gym. Her name is Suzan. She is sooooo hot.
A friend from work.
Amy. You remember her from that party last week right?
