None of your business.
I've been going out with Sarah for a couple of week's now.
A very pretty girl.
Do you remember Mary in the same class? We got close after the chemistry test.
I went out with Kendall, you know, Stephen's little sister.
Someone I met at the bar last week.
I am a lucky guy. I was asked out at the gym. Her name is Suzan. She is sooooo hot.
A girl from my Sociology class. I think I'm going to ask her out again.
