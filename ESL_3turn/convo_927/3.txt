This girl I met at the bookstore.
I've been going out with Sarah for a couple of week's now.
A very pretty girl.
Do you remember Mary in the same class? We got close after the chemistry test.
Someone I met at the bar last week.
It wasn't really a date. Six of us went to the movies.
A friend from work.
It was a blind date. Her name was Mallory and she was really fun to be with.
