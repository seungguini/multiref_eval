This girl I met at the bookstore.
I will go with Brad Pitt. I wish hahaha.
I've been going out with Sarah for a couple of week's now.
A very pretty girl.
I went out with Kendall, you know, Stephen's little sister.
It wasn't really a date. Six of us went to the movies.
A friend from work.
Amy. You remember her from that party last week right?
