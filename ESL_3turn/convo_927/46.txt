This girl I met at the bookstore.
A very pretty girl.
I went out with Sam, the guy across the hall.
I went out with Kendall, you know, Stephen's little sister.
Someone I met at the bar last week.
It wasn't really a date. Six of us went to the movies.
A friend from work.
A girl from my Sociology class. I think I'm going to ask her out again.
