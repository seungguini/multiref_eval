None of your business.
I've been going out with Sarah for a couple of week's now.
I went out with Sam, the guy across the hall.
Do you remember Mary in the same class? We got close after the chemistry test.
Someone I met at the bar last week.
I am a lucky guy. I was asked out at the gym. Her name is Suzan. She is sooooo hot.
It wasn't really a date. Six of us went to the movies.
A friend from work.
