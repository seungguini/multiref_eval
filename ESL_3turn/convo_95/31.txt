I can't believe it could get even hotter!
I need to fix my air conditioner!
I wonder what the weather report says.
Time to go for a swim!
We're expecting rain this afternoon, so maybe it will cool off.
Is this whole week going to be this warm?
I wonder if this is a record breaker for this area?
When is it supposed to cool down?
