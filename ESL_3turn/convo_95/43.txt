I can't believe it could get even hotter!
I need to fix my air conditioner!
We should go swimming.
I wonder what the weather report says.
We should go to the mall where there is air conditioning.
We're expecting rain this afternoon, so maybe it will cool off.
I wonder if this is a record breaker for this area?
When is it supposed to cool down?
