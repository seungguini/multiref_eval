I can't believe it could get even hotter!
I need to fix my air conditioner!
We should go swimming.
The hottest point in the day is usually between 2:00 PM and 3:00 PM.
I wonder what the weather report says.
Time to go for a swim!
Is this whole week going to be this warm?
When is it supposed to cool down?
