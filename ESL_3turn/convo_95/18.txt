I can't believe it could get even hotter!
I need to fix my air conditioner!
We should go swimming.
I wonder what the weather report says.
We should go to the mall where there is air conditioning.
We're expecting rain this afternoon, so maybe it will cool off.
Is this whole week going to be this warm?
I wonder if this is a record breaker for this area?
