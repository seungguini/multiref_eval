I got it on sale.
It didn't cost much because there was a deal the store was offering that day.
Nope! I got it for $35 dollars at Ross.
The price was decent because I had a coupon.

Thank you, I actually got it as a gift from my Mom.
I treated myself.
I decided to splurge.
I confess, it was a gift from Steven.
