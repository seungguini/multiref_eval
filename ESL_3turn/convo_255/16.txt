I got it on sale.
It didn't cost much because there was a deal the store was offering that day.
Nope! I got it for $35 dollars at Ross.
The price was decent because I had a coupon.
You know me, money is no object.
Well, it did cost me quite a bit.
I decided to splurge.
I confess, it was a gift from Steven.
