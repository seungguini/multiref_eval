Have you looked on Craigslist?
My sister has an old car she's trying to get rid of.
Have you checked any used car dealerships?
That is unrealistic.
Have you looked online?
Oh, easy, there is a ton of great stuff out there.
Did you check out Craigslist?
Do you know anyone who wants to sell their old car?
