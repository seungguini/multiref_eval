Have you looked on Craigslist?
I have a friend trying to sell a junker.
We can find something, but it won't be great.
My sister has an old car she's trying to get rid of.
That is unrealistic.
Oh, easy, there is a ton of great stuff out there.
Did you check out Craigslist?
Do you know anyone who wants to sell their old car?
