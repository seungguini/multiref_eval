You can get a crappy used one for that.
We can find something, but it won't be great.
My sister has an old car she's trying to get rid of.
Have you checked any used car dealerships?
That is unrealistic.
Have you looked online?
Oh, easy, there is a ton of great stuff out there.
Do you know anyone who wants to sell their old car?
