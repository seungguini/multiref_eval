Have you looked on Craigslist?
You can get a crappy used one for that.
We can find something, but it won't be great.
My sister has an old car she's trying to get rid of.
Have you looked online?
Oh, easy, there is a ton of great stuff out there.
Did you check out Craigslist?
Do you know anyone who wants to sell their old car?
