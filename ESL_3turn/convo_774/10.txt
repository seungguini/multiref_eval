You can get a crappy used one for that.
We can find something, but it won't be great.
That's not much of a budget.
My sister has an old car she's trying to get rid of.
Have you checked any used car dealerships?
That is unrealistic.
Did you check out Craigslist?
Do you know anyone who wants to sell their old car?
