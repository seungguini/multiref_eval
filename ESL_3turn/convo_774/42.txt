Have you looked on Craigslist?
You can get a crappy used one for that.
I have a friend trying to sell a junker.
We can find something, but it won't be great.
That's not much of a budget.
My sister has an old car she's trying to get rid of.
Have you checked any used car dealerships?
Oh, easy, there is a ton of great stuff out there.
