Maybe the baby needs a diaper change.
This is why I will never have children.
Maybe it needs a new diaper.
I'm glad that my stop is the next one!
I wish I didn't have to take the bus.
This is one of the reasons why I've decided not to have kids.
I feel bad for the baby and the mother.
I wonder what is wrong?
