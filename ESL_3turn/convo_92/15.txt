Maybe the baby needs a diaper change.
This is why I will never have children.
Maybe it needs a new diaper.
I wish they would just get off the bus!
I don't think the baby is hungry then.
This is one of the reasons why I've decided not to have kids.
I feel bad for the baby and the mother.
I wonder what is wrong?
