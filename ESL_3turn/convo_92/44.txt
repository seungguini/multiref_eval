Maybe the baby needs a diaper change.
This is why I will never have children.
Maybe it needs a new diaper.
I don't think the baby is hungry then.
I wish I didn't have to take the bus.
This is one of the reasons why I've decided not to have kids.
I wonder what is wrong?
I heard that babies get gas a lot.
