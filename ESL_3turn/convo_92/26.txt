Maybe the baby needs a diaper change.
I wish they would just get off the bus!
I don't think the baby is hungry then.
I'm glad that my stop is the next one!
I wish I didn't have to take the bus.
This is one of the reasons why I've decided not to have kids.
I wonder what is wrong?
I heard that babies get gas a lot.
