Cats are adorable.
But cats kill birds!
Cats can climb.
But cats eat birds.
Cats get to sleep all day.
That's a great point.
You're right about birds.
So?
Cats can live indoors and be safer.
I guess you're right.
People spoil their cats.
I still think cats are cooler.
I just want to be a cat and sleep all day.
