What cut did you order?
can't you just cut it off
Oh come on, just eat the steak.
Cut the fat off.
The fat gives it a lot of flavor, are you sure it's too much?
huh . i don't know much about steak
Is it really that big of a deal?
I'll flag down the waiter
i don't think you can send it back for that
If you're not going to eat, I will.
oh my god . please don't embarrass me
Really? Let me see.
okay . i'm going to run to the restroom
Somehow I doubt that.
