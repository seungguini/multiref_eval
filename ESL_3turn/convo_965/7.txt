That's silly! I'll be careful!
I suppose that's a good point.
Well I care about my hair!
They cramp my style. If my hair is messed up then Sandra will think I'm a nerd.
I guess you're right.
That's easy for you to say because you don't have any hair.
My hair wouldn't look so good with blood in it, I suppose.
Sorry it's more important for me to look cool.
