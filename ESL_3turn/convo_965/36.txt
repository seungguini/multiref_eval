That's silly! I'll be careful!
Well I care about my hair!
They cramp my style. If my hair is messed up then Sandra will think I'm a nerd.
You are right.
My hair wouldn't look so good with blood in it, I suppose.
My head is already messed up.
But I never crash.
Sorry it's more important for me to look cool.
