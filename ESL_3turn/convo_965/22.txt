That's silly! I'll be careful!
Well I care about my hair!
That's easy for you to say because you don't have any hair.
You are right.
Don't tell me how to ride baby! I live life on the edge.
My hair wouldn't look so good with blood in it, I suppose.
But I never crash.
Sorry it's more important for me to look cool.
