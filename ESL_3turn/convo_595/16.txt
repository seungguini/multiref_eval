True, are you good with plants?
then they die
I know, that's why im doing it
Does your apartment building allow window planters?
not with the poor gardening I am doing
I used to have a garden, but work leaves me no spare time for it!
I dont care about flowers, its my wife's garden
I really have better luck with air plants.
