Those look good though.
No, they are the equivalent of fries in America.
Okay thanks for letting me know.
I thought that the chips served with fish & chips were French fries, not potato chips.
Don't be silly, they look great!
Those are still delcious as well.
Perhaps they have sweet potato chips.
I don't want potato chips.
