Being one minute late still counts as late.
Late is late.
I cut the fee in half then.
You should have left early to make it before there was a chance of being late.
I'll let it go this time but please follow the rules for the next time.
It still will cost $5.
Would you like to see the manager?
Will the be cash or charge?
