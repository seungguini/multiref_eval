You're still late.
Being one minute late still counts as late.
Don't worry about it then.
I cut the fee in half then.
You should have left early to make it before there was a chance of being late.
It still will cost $5.
I did see you speed walk down the hallway. Okay, I'll let this one slide.
Would you like to see the manager?
