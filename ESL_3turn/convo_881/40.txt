You're still late.
Late is late.
Don't worry about it then.
You should have left early to make it before there was a chance of being late.
I'll let it go this time but please follow the rules for the next time.
I did see you speed walk down the hallway. Okay, I'll let this one slide.
Would you like to see the manager?
Will the be cash or charge?
