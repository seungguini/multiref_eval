I don't see him very much.
Not really?
Only when his parents are out of town.
He's been over a few times.
Yes, he is over at our house all the time.
Why are you asking?
Not really. Sometimes I go to his house though.
No, he's never been to my house.
No, he doesn't leave the house much.
He doesn't come over too often.
We've never spoken, to be honest.
