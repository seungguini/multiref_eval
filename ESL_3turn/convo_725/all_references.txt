I hate the park, no way.
That sounds nice.
Sounds great!
It's kinda hot for that, don't you think?
That would be a good walk.
But it's getting dark.
Which park?
Ugh, again?
How far is the park?
When do you want to go?
It's getting to late for that.
What about we sit there and rest for a minute before we head back?
That would be great!
It's a little creepy at night.
Want to take the dog with us?
Great idea!
I hope there aren't any dogs around.
