Well I'm getting married next week.
I'm sorry, life has been keeping me busy.
Sorry about that, I've been busy.
I have a cease and desist letter from the neighbor.
I completed my last chemo treatment and am cancer free now.
I was traveling in a foreign country.
Let me share this good news!
I hope you give me the proper respect that an inspector general is owed.
