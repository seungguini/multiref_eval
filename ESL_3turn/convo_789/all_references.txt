Yes he knew
He's hurt and is complaining about you.
He is lying.
Well he did know.
I just love the snow
You should appologize.
He's just trying to get me in trouble.
I just thought it was implied, since I threw snow at him.
I did hurt him did I
The ball hit him hard.
I think he was probably kidding with you.
Sorry mom.
so what matter does it make
You need to be careful next time.
I can't believe he said that.
I didn't think it would upset him.
he knows now
He didn't like you throwing the ball at him.
Sometimes he is such a little jerk.
I don't know why he's always such a tattle tale.
