I don't know if that's a good idea.
I'm still unpacking, now about a rain check?
What movie were you thinking of?
Sure, that sounds fun.
Sure, what's playing that's good?
Sure. I need a break from unpacking.
That would be very nice.
Sorry, I think I'm going to stay in.
Maybe, what's playing?
Not tonight.
At your place or the theater?
Can I take a rain check?
I'm really tired, how about some other time?
Sure, why not?
