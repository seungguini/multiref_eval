Really?
Of course I want to go!
I don't think so.
That would be great, thanks!
Thank you so much.
Would this be like a date?
You know I have a boyfriend.
Oh no! I have to work that night!
I would love to join you.
I actually have plans on Friday, but thank you anyway.
This is not appropriate for you to ask me.
Are you sure?
Aren't you bringing your girlfriend?
I would love to.
That sounds like it would be so much fun.
