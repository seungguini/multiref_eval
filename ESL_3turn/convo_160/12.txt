Will the ads tell me more about the candidate's views?
Until I know more about your candidate, I really can't help answer his campaign.
Yeah, no.
Are the ads going to be positive for the candidate or negative against the opponent?
I've already donated to his oppnents campaign.
I don't think so.
Sure, I like you're candidate and want to help him win.
How long will the ads be?
