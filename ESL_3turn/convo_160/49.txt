Will the ads tell me more about the candidate's views?
Until I know more about your candidate, I really can't help answer his campaign.
How much money are you trying to raise?
Are the ads going to be positive for the candidate or negative against the opponent?
I've already donated to his oppnents campaign.
I don't think so.
No, thank you. I don't feel comfortable donating at this time.
Sure, I like you're candidate and want to help him win.
