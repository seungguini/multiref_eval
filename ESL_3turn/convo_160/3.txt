Will the ads tell me more about the candidate's views?
Until I know more about your candidate, I really can't help answer his campaign.
How much money are you trying to raise?
Are the ads going to be positive for the candidate or negative against the opponent?
I've already donated to his oppnents campaign.
I don't think so.
On which channel will the ads run?
How long will the ads be?
