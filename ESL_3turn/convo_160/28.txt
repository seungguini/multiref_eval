Will the ads tell me more about the candidate's views?
Yeah, no.
Are the ads going to be positive for the candidate or negative against the opponent?
I've already donated to his oppnents campaign.
I don't think so.
On which channel will the ads run?
Sure, I like you're candidate and want to help him win.
How long will the ads be?
