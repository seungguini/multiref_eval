Ahh yes, right this way
Welcome Mr Roberts
Nice to meet you, Mr. Roberts. It looks like we have you in Room 423.
I'm sorry, I don't see your name
Do you have a preference for a low floor or high one?
Alright, I'll need a credit card
We offer complimentary breakfast every morning at 6 am.
I'll get you checked in.
