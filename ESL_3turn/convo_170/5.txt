Perfect, let me check and see if we have you in our system.
Thank you, Mr. Roberts.
Welcome Mr Roberts
Nice to meet you, Mr. Roberts. It looks like we have you in Room 423.
I can see your reservation on my screen.
Do you have a preference for a low floor or high one?
Alright, I'll need a credit card
I'll get you checked in.
