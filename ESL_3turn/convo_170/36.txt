Thank you, Mr. Roberts.
Ahh yes, right this way
Nice to meet you, Mr. Roberts. It looks like we have you in Room 423.
I can see your reservation on my screen.
Do you have a preference for a low floor or high one?
Do you need bellhop service?
Your check in time isn't for another 2 hours
I'll get you checked in.
