You are an awful driver.
You could have caused an accident.
You need to pay more attention.
I hope this stop light doesn't have cameras.
Pay attention, please.
You're an idiot!
Luckily we weren't involved in an accident.
You could have killed someone!
That was my near-death experience for the day.
I'll drive from now on!
What is wrong with you?
Why don't you pull over and I'll walk.
