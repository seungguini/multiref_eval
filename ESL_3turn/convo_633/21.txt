I've been thinking about turning one of these into a skoolie.
I like that it has a television screen on every seat.
I'm glad it's private.
And it has a nice big bathroom in the back.
I can't believe it even has a bar.
And all of the seats recline.
I'm glad we booked the trip with this company.
I hope that all of the seats don't get filled up.
