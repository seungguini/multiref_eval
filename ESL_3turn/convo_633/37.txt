I've been thinking about turning one of these into a skoolie.
This is going to be a great tour.
Good thing, because we have a long trip ahead of us.
I'm glad it's private.
Yes, and lots of channels to choose from.
I can't believe it even has a bar.
And all of the seats recline.
I hope that all of the seats don't get filled up.
