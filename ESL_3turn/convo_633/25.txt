I've been thinking about turning one of these into a skoolie.
And it is so new.
This is going to be a great tour.
Good thing, because we have a long trip ahead of us.
I can't believe it even has a bar.
And all of the seats recline.
I'm glad we booked the trip with this company.
I hope that all of the seats don't get filled up.
