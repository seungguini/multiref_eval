I've been thinking about turning one of these into a skoolie.
And it is so new.
I like that it has a television screen on every seat.
This is going to be a great tour.
Good thing, because we have a long trip ahead of us.
I'm glad it's private.
Yes, and lots of channels to choose from.
I'm glad we booked the trip with this company.
