I've been thinking about turning one of these into a skoolie.
And it is so new.
Good thing, because we have a long trip ahead of us.
Yes, and lots of channels to choose from.
And it has a nice big bathroom in the back.
And all of the seats recline.
I'm glad we booked the trip with this company.
I hope that all of the seats don't get filled up.
