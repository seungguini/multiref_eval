It is open late for people like you.
Because the owners are greedy.
I think it's great that it is open late!
You got that rignt, pal.
I don't know. I guess they want the late night crowd.
Muahahah
I think the owner is thinking about it. It's pretty dead after midnight.
We're open 24 hours a day, and night!
