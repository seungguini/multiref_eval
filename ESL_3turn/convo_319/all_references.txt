It is open late for people like you.
It is open 24 hours.
Because the owners are greedy.
There's a factory that has three shifts nearby.
I think it's great that it is open late!
They don't until they still have customers.
You got that rignt, pal.
I don't know. I guess they want the late night crowd.
I am sure they get a lot of late night business.
Muahahah
I think the owner is thinking about it. It's pretty dead after midnight.
Muahahaha
We're open 24 hours a day, and night!
We are evil scientists!
