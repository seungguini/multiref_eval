I can, what time would you like me to pick you up?
Yeah, no problem!
I have to go straight from a doctors appointment, sorry.
Sure, if you can give me some gas money.
My friend is driving me.
I was planning on walking there.
Sure! I'll pick you up around 8:00.
I can do that. What time will you be ready?
