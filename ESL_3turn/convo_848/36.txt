Sure!
I can, what time would you like me to pick you up?
I have to go straight from a doctors appointment, sorry.
Sure, if you can give me some gas money.
I'd love to, where do you live?
I was planning on walking there.
Sure! I'll pick you up around 8:00.
I can do that. What time will you be ready?
