Sure!
I can, what time would you like me to pick you up?
I'm sorry, I need a ride myself.
I have to go straight from a doctors appointment, sorry.
No, I can't.  I already have a car full of people to take there.
Sure, if you can give me some gas money.
Sure! I'll pick you up around 8:00.
I can do that. What time will you be ready?
