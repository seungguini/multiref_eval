Sure!
I'm sorry, I need a ride myself.
I have to go straight from a doctors appointment, sorry.
No, I can't.  I already have a car full of people to take there.
Sure, if you can give me some gas money.
My friend is driving me.
I was planning on walking there.
I can do that. What time will you be ready?
