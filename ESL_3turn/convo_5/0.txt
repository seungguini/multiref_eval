There's one on her desk
Do you mind using a sharp knife instead?
You can borrow mine.
Look over in my desk, it should be by the erasers.
Obviously, but is it a thick pencil?
You can use my eyeliner sharpener.
The pencil sharpener is on the desk.
Sorry I don't know, I don't have one, i'm sure someone else has one though.
