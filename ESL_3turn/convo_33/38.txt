Well you should be able to see crime rates on a website.
Let's start you a list.
Are you wanting to live on campus or to get an apartment nearby?
Check out the crime rates in the local papers.
What are some of your other preferences besides safety?
Have you started looking at any possible places to transfer to?
If you want a safer University, I would suggest looking away from urban areas or cities.
Maybe you should consider University in a smaller town then.
