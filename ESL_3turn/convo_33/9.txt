Well you should be able to see crime rates on a website.
Are you wanting to live on campus or to get an apartment nearby?
What are some of your other preferences besides safety?
Have you started looking at any possible places to transfer to?
What are some other things that you would like?
Maybe you should consider University in a smaller town then.
Have you looked at South Plains University?
There's plenty of Universities that are safe and away from crime.
