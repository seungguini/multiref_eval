Well you should be able to see crime rates on a website.
There's a lot of safe Universities, it just takes some additional research.
Are you wanting to live on campus or to get an apartment nearby?
Check out the crime rates in the local papers.
We can definitely find you a safe University.
What are some of your other preferences besides safety?
If you want a safer University, I would suggest looking away from urban areas or cities.
Maybe you should consider University in a smaller town then.
