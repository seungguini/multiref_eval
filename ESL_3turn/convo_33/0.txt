Well you should be able to see crime rates on a website.
There's a lot of safe Universities, it just takes some additional research.
Check out the crime rates in the local papers.
What are some of your other preferences besides safety?
If you want a safer University, I would suggest looking away from urban areas or cities.
What are some other things that you would like?
Maybe you should consider University in a smaller town then.
Have you looked at South Plains University?
