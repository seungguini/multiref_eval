Well you should be able to see crime rates on a website.
Let's start you a list.
There's a lot of safe Universities, it just takes some additional research.
Are you wanting to live on campus or to get an apartment nearby?
Check out the crime rates in the local papers.
If you want a safer University, I would suggest looking away from urban areas or cities.
What are some other things that you would like?
Maybe you should consider University in a smaller town then.
