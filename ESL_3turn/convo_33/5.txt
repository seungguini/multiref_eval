Well you should be able to see crime rates on a website.
Let's start you a list.
Are you wanting to live on campus or to get an apartment nearby?
Check out the crime rates in the local papers.
You need to research university's that are safe.
Have you started looking at any possible places to transfer to?
If you want a safer University, I would suggest looking away from urban areas or cities.
There's plenty of Universities that are safe and away from crime.
