Look at the signs at the stop.
I try to read the bus sch.
There are route maps available online.
I will ask the lady at the desk.
The top of the bus line has the destination on it.
They will tell you when you buy your ticket which bus you need to take.
Sometimes I have to just ask the bus driver.
I always ask someone who works here.
