I try to read the bus sch.
You have to read the schedules carefully.
There's a sign up there.
The top of the bus line has the destination on it.
Sometimes I have to just ask the bus driver.
It will say the bus line on your ticket.
You just kind of have to figure it out.
I always ask someone who works here.
