I try to read the bus sch.
There's a sign up there.
There are route maps available online.
I will ask the lady at the desk.
The top of the bus line has the destination on it.
They will tell you when you buy your ticket which bus you need to take.
You just kind of have to figure it out.
I always ask someone who works here.
