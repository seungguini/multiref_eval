Look at the signs at the stop.
I try to read the bus sch.
You have to read the schedules carefully.
They will tell you when you buy your ticket which bus you need to take.
Sometimes I have to just ask the bus driver.
It will say the bus line on your ticket.
You just kind of have to figure it out.
I always ask someone who works here.
