Look at the signs at the stop.
I try to read the bus sch.
You have to read the schedules carefully.
There's a sign up there.
There are route maps available online.
I will ask the lady at the desk.
The top of the bus line has the destination on it.
They will tell you when you buy your ticket which bus you need to take.
Sometimes I have to just ask the bus driver.
It will say the bus line on your ticket.
You just kind of have to figure it out.
I always ask someone who works here.
