Look at the signs at the stop.
I try to read the bus sch.
You have to read the schedules carefully.
There are route maps available online.
The top of the bus line has the destination on it.
They will tell you when you buy your ticket which bus you need to take.
Sometimes I have to just ask the bus driver.
It will say the bus line on your ticket.
