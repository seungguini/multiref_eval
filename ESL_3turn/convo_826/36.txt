Look at the signs at the stop.
I try to read the bus sch.
You have to read the schedules carefully.
There are route maps available online.
They will tell you when you buy your ticket which bus you need to take.
Sometimes I have to just ask the bus driver.
It will say the bus line on your ticket.
You just kind of have to figure it out.
