Look at the signs at the stop.
You have to read the schedules carefully.
There are route maps available online.
I will ask the lady at the desk.
They will tell you when you buy your ticket which bus you need to take.
Sometimes I have to just ask the bus driver.
It will say the bus line on your ticket.
You just kind of have to figure it out.
