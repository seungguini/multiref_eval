Just picture everyone in their underwear!
You'll do fine just don't think about it.
Just calm down and relax, you got this.
Everyone is just as nervous to give theirs when it is their turn
They're just as nervous as you are.
Don't sweat it, you'll do great.
Just focus on the presentation, you'll be fine.
I don't like audiences either.
