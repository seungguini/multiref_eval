Just imagine everyone is naked!
Everyone is just as nervous to give theirs when it is their turn
They're just as nervous as you are.
You already did the hard work, this is the easy part.
You are going to do great!
Don't sweat it, you'll do great.
Just focus on the presentation, you'll be fine.
I don't like audiences either.
