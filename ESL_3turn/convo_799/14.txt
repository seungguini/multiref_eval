You'll do fine just don't think about it.
Just imagine everyone is naked!
Everyone is just as nervous to give theirs when it is their turn
They're just as nervous as you are.
If you practice a lot, it might help.
You already did the hard work, this is the easy part.
Don't sweat it, you'll do great.
Just focus on the presentation, you'll be fine.
