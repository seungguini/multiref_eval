Just picture everyone in their underwear!
You'll do fine just don't think about it.
Just imagine everyone is naked!
They're just as nervous as you are.
You already did the hard work, this is the easy part.
Just don't make eye contact with anyone.
Just focus on the presentation, you'll be fine.
I don't like audiences either.
