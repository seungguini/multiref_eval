Just picture everyone in their underwear!
You'll do fine just don't think about it.
Just calm down and relax, you got this.
You are going to do great!
Don't sweat it, you'll do great.
Just don't make eye contact with anyone.
Just focus on the presentation, you'll be fine.
I don't like audiences either.
