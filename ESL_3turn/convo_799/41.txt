You'll do fine just don't think about it.
Just calm down and relax, you got this.
Everyone is just as nervous to give theirs when it is their turn
If you practice a lot, it might help.
You already did the hard work, this is the easy part.
Don't sweat it, you'll do great.
Just don't make eye contact with anyone.
I'm the same way
