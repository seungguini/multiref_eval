You'll do fine just don't think about it.
Just calm down and relax, you got this.
Everyone is just as nervous to give theirs when it is their turn
They're just as nervous as you are.
If you practice a lot, it might help.
Just don't make eye contact with anyone.
Just focus on the presentation, you'll be fine.
I'm the same way
