Just picture everyone in their underwear!
You'll do fine just don't think about it.
Just calm down and relax, you got this.
If you practice a lot, it might help.
You already did the hard work, this is the easy part.
You are going to do great!
Just focus on the presentation, you'll be fine.
I don't like audiences either.
