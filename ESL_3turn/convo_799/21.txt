You'll do fine just don't think about it.
Just calm down and relax, you got this.
Everyone is just as nervous to give theirs when it is their turn
They're just as nervous as you are.
If you practice a lot, it might help.
You already did the hard work, this is the easy part.
Just don't make eye contact with anyone.
I'm the same way
