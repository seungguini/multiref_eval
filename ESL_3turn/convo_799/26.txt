Just picture everyone in their underwear!
Just calm down and relax, you got this.
Everyone is just as nervous to give theirs when it is their turn
You already did the hard work, this is the easy part.
You are going to do great!
Don't sweat it, you'll do great.
Just don't make eye contact with anyone.
Just focus on the presentation, you'll be fine.
