You'll do fine just don't think about it.
Just imagine everyone is naked!
If you practice a lot, it might help.
You already did the hard work, this is the easy part.
Don't sweat it, you'll do great.
Just don't make eye contact with anyone.
Just focus on the presentation, you'll be fine.
I don't like audiences either.
