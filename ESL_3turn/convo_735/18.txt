I'm really sorry, but I'm not going to make it in today. My car broke down on the freeway.
I'm at the fron foor, can you let me in?
Just leaving the Smith site. Should I head back to the office, or do you have another job for me?
I am en route, will be there soon!
I can't come in today. I have the flu.
I'm at a meeting with some investors.
I'm on vacation, don't you remember?
Still at home. Do you have work for me today?
