I'm running a little late because my son forgot his lunchbox at home.
I'm currently stuck in traffic which means I'll be late.
Just leaving the Smith site. Should I head back to the office, or do you have another job for me?
I am en route, will be there soon!
I can't come in today. I have the flu.
Finishing up at the Cambridge job. Were you expecting me in the office?
I'm on vacation, don't you remember?
Still at home. Do you have work for me today?
