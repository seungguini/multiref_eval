I'm really sorry, but I'm not going to make it in today. My car broke down on the freeway.
I'm running a little late because my son forgot his lunchbox at home.
I'm currently stuck in traffic which means I'll be late.
Just leaving the Smith site. Should I head back to the office, or do you have another job for me?
I am en route, will be there soon!
I can't come in today. I have the flu.
Finishing up at the Cambridge job. Were you expecting me in the office?
I'm on vacation, don't you remember?
