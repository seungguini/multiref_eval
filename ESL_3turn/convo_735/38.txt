I'm really sorry, but I'm not going to make it in today. My car broke down on the freeway.
I'm at the fron foor, can you let me in?
I'm currently stuck in traffic which means I'll be late.
I am en route, will be there soon!
I can't come in today. I have the flu.
I'm at a meeting with some investors.
Finishing up at the Cambridge job. Were you expecting me in the office?
Still at home. Do you have work for me today?
