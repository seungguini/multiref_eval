I'm really sorry, but I'm not going to make it in today. My car broke down on the freeway.
I'm at the fron foor, can you let me in?
I'm running a little late because my son forgot his lunchbox at home.
I'm currently stuck in traffic which means I'll be late.
I am en route, will be there soon!
Finishing up at the Cambridge job. Were you expecting me in the office?
I'm on vacation, don't you remember?
Still at home. Do you have work for me today?
