I'm really sorry, but I'm not going to make it in today. My car broke down on the freeway.
I'm at the fron foor, can you let me in?
I'm running a little late because my son forgot his lunchbox at home.
Just leaving the Smith site. Should I head back to the office, or do you have another job for me?
I am en route, will be there soon!
I can't come in today. I have the flu.
I'm at a meeting with some investors.
Still at home. Do you have work for me today?
