I'm at the fron foor, can you let me in?
I'm running a little late because my son forgot his lunchbox at home.
I'm currently stuck in traffic which means I'll be late.
Just leaving the Smith site. Should I head back to the office, or do you have another job for me?
I am en route, will be there soon!
I can't come in today. I have the flu.
I'm at a meeting with some investors.
I'm on vacation, don't you remember?
