I'm really sorry, but I'm not going to make it in today. My car broke down on the freeway.
I'm at the fron foor, can you let me in?
I'm currently stuck in traffic which means I'll be late.
Just leaving the Smith site. Should I head back to the office, or do you have another job for me?
I am en route, will be there soon!
I'm at a meeting with some investors.
Finishing up at the Cambridge job. Were you expecting me in the office?
Still at home. Do you have work for me today?
