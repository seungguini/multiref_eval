That's a lot of veterans!
we were all catching up and talking about our plans
That's early in the morning.
where did you land?
I was sitting next to one of my pals Bob and had a window seat
The flight was on time and we landed at noon
That must have been a big plane.
the plane was nearly empty aside from our group so we had tons of space to spread out!
