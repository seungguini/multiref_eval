It was perfect weather but then the plane hit turbulence
where you scared?
we were all catching up and talking about our plans
where did you land?
The flight was on time and we landed at noon
That must have been a big plane.
the plane was nearly empty aside from our group so we had tons of space to spread out!
Tell me more!
