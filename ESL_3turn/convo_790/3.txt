It was perfect weather but then the plane hit turbulence
we were all catching up and talking about our plans
That's early in the morning.
where did you land?
I was sitting next to one of my pals Bob and had a window seat
The flight was on time and we landed at noon
That must have been a big plane.
Tell me more!
