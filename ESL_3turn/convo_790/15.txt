It was perfect weather but then the plane hit turbulence
That's a lot of veterans!
Where did you learn that?
we were all catching up and talking about our plans
I was sitting next to one of my pals Bob and had a window seat
Wow, really?
the plane was nearly empty aside from our group so we had tons of space to spread out!
Tell me more!
