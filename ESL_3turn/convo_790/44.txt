It was perfect weather but then the plane hit turbulence
That's a lot of veterans!
Where did you learn that?
we were all catching up and talking about our plans
That's early in the morning.
Wow, that's pretty wild.
I was sitting next to one of my pals Bob and had a window seat
That must have been a big plane.
