where you scared?
That's early in the morning.
I was sitting next to one of my pals Bob and had a window seat
Wow, really?
The flight was on time and we landed at noon
That must have been a big plane.
the plane was nearly empty aside from our group so we had tons of space to spread out!
Tell me more!
