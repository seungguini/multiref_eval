It was perfect weather but then the plane hit turbulence
Where did you learn that?
Wow, that's pretty wild.
where did you land?
I was sitting next to one of my pals Bob and had a window seat
Wow, really?
the plane was nearly empty aside from our group so we had tons of space to spread out!
Tell me more!
