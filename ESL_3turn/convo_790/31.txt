It was perfect weather but then the plane hit turbulence
That's a lot of veterans!
where you scared?
we were all catching up and talking about our plans
Wow, that's pretty wild.
Wow, really?
That must have been a big plane.
the plane was nearly empty aside from our group so we had tons of space to spread out!
