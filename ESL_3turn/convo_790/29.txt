It was perfect weather but then the plane hit turbulence
That's a lot of veterans!
we were all catching up and talking about our plans
That's early in the morning.
where did you land?
I was sitting next to one of my pals Bob and had a window seat
the plane was nearly empty aside from our group so we had tons of space to spread out!
Tell me more!
