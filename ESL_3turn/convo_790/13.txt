It was perfect weather but then the plane hit turbulence
Where did you learn that?
where you scared?
we were all catching up and talking about our plans
That's early in the morning.
where did you land?
I was sitting next to one of my pals Bob and had a window seat
the plane was nearly empty aside from our group so we had tons of space to spread out!
