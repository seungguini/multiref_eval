It was perfect weather but then the plane hit turbulence
That's a lot of veterans!
where you scared?
Wow, that's pretty wild.
I was sitting next to one of my pals Bob and had a window seat
The flight was on time and we landed at noon
That must have been a big plane.
the plane was nearly empty aside from our group so we had tons of space to spread out!
