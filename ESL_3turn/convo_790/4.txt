It was perfect weather but then the plane hit turbulence
Where did you learn that?
we were all catching up and talking about our plans
Wow, that's pretty wild.
I was sitting next to one of my pals Bob and had a window seat
That must have been a big plane.
the plane was nearly empty aside from our group so we had tons of space to spread out!
Tell me more!
