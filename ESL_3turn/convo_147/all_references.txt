No I am waiting for payday.
No.
No, I haven't. It's so expensive.
No, not yet.
I don't think I'll be needing the textbook this semester.
Why are you asking?
I've been looking for the textbook online, so I'll order mine soon. You?
I'm still waiting on the loan approval.
I bought the last copy from the bookstore yesterday.
Yes I have, did you order yours?
Yes. I picked it up yesterday.
There's a textbook?
I ordered it online, but I'm still waiting for it to come in the mail.
No, I heard we don't even really need it.
I'm getting it after class today.
No, I'm sharing one with Susan.
