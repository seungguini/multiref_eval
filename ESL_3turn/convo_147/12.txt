No I am waiting for payday.
No, not yet.
I don't think I'll be needing the textbook this semester.
I'm still waiting on the loan approval.
Yes I have, did you order yours?
Yes. I picked it up yesterday.
I ordered it online, but I'm still waiting for it to come in the mail.
No, I heard we don't even really need it.
