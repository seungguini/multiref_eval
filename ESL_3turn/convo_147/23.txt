No I am waiting for payday.
No.
I've been looking for the textbook online, so I'll order mine soon. You?
I'm still waiting on the loan approval.
Yes I have, did you order yours?
Yes. I picked it up yesterday.
I ordered it online, but I'm still waiting for it to come in the mail.
I'm getting it after class today.
