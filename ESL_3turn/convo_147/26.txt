No, not yet.
I don't think I'll be needing the textbook this semester.
I've been looking for the textbook online, so I'll order mine soon. You?
I bought the last copy from the bookstore yesterday.
There's a textbook?
I ordered it online, but I'm still waiting for it to come in the mail.
No, I heard we don't even really need it.
