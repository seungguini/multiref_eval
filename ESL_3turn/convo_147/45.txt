No I am waiting for payday.
No, I haven't. It's so expensive.
I've been looking for the textbook online, so I'll order mine soon. You?
I bought the last copy from the bookstore yesterday.
Yes. I picked it up yesterday.
I ordered it online, but I'm still waiting for it to come in the mail.
No, I heard we don't even really need it.
I'm getting it after class today.
