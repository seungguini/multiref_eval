I don't know, it was a gift.
It's not for sale.
To much for you.
I didn't look at the price yet.
About $50.
$20.
5 dollars bought it a thrift store.
Only 4$.
That's kind of a rude question.
I'm giving it away.
Don't worry about it.
I don't remember.
On sale for $23.99.
Not sure i got it for my birthday.
They don't make it anymore.
Too much.
100 dollars got to rock all the new Gucci.
