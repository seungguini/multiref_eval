Michael Jordan of course.
I think Babe Ruth.
Babe Ruth, of course!
I can't decide.
Kobe of course.
By what measure?
I can't pick just one.
I don't like narrowing it down.
Right now its Jordan but I'll give LeBron a few more years.
I really don't know.
Definitely someone from the Yankees!
Who do you think?
Who would you say is the greatest?
Don't you know what my answer is going to be?
Probably Hank Aaron.
