Well, I did.
I definitely watered them this morning.
Well, I can assure you that I did water the plants.
You can water them again if you don't think i did a good enough job.
Why don't you think it looks like I watered them?
Maybe they need to be watered again.
How can you tell?
I can water them again if you want.
