I definitely watered them this morning.
You can water them again if you don't think i did a good enough job.
Why don't you think it looks like I watered them?
Maybe they need to be watered again.
Maybe I didn't put enough water on them.
They look fine.
I can water them again if you want.
You don't believe me?
