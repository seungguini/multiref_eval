Well, I can assure you that I did water the plants.
You can water them again if you don't think i did a good enough job.
Why don't you think it looks like I watered them?
How can you tell?
Maybe I didn't put enough water on them.
They look fine.
I can water them again if you want.
I promise that I watered them this morning!
