I definitely watered them this morning.
Well, I can assure you that I did water the plants.
You can water them again if you don't think i did a good enough job.
Why don't you think it looks like I watered them?
Maybe they need to be watered again.
Yes it does!
You don't believe me?
I promise that I watered them this morning!
