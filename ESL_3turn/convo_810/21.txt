It all starts when you're young.
It's one thing.
Yeah, that is it.
I believe so.
I mean, it could also be low employment rates and poor social support, but it's probably the parent's fault.
I think that's a major cause.
I'm sure there are other reasons, too.
If kids don't learn when they are young, they'll never learn.
