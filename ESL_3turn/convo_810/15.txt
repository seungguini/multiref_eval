It all starts when you're young.
Yeah, that is it.
Kids learn from their parents and their community.
I mean, it could also be low employment rates and poor social support, but it's probably the parent's fault.
That, and the music of today which carries a bad influence.
I think that's a major cause.
I'm sure there are other reasons, too.
If kids don't learn when they are young, they'll never learn.
