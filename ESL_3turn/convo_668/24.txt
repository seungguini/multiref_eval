I didn't do my chores.
I'm grounded.
I'm grounded.
My grades have been slipping and she wants me to study more and spend more time at home.
Because she is a mean woman.
Frankly, she doesn't like me spending time with you.
My family is coming over.
Too many people have the flu right now and she doesn't want me getting sick.
