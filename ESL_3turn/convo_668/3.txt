I failed my last english exam.
My grades have been slipping and she wants me to study more and spend more time at home.
Because she is a mean woman.
I'm in trouble for staying out to late.
I have a few projects that I have to focus on for school.
I've been sick.
I had the flu.
I have to babysit my siblings.
