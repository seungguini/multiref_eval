I failed my last english exam.
I'm grounded.
My grades have been slipping and she wants me to study more and spend more time at home.
I have a few projects that I have to focus on for school.
Frankly, she doesn't like me spending time with you.
I had the flu.
My family is coming over.
I have to babysit my siblings.
