I failed my last english exam.
I'm grounded.
I'm in trouble for staying out to late.
I have a few projects that I have to focus on for school.
Frankly, she doesn't like me spending time with you.
I had the flu.
Too many people have the flu right now and she doesn't want me getting sick.
I have to babysit my siblings.
