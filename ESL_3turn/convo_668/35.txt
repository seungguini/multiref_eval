I failed my last english exam.
I'm grounded.
Because she is a mean woman.
I'm in trouble for staying out to late.
Frankly, she doesn't like me spending time with you.
My family is coming over.
Too many people have the flu right now and she doesn't want me getting sick.
I have to babysit my siblings.
