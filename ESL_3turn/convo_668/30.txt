I failed my last english exam.
I didn't do my chores.
I'm grounded.
My grades have been slipping and she wants me to study more and spend more time at home.
Because she is a mean woman.
I'm in trouble for staying out to late.
Too many people have the flu right now and she doesn't want me getting sick.
I have to babysit my siblings.
