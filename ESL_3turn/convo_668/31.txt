I failed my last english exam.
I'm grounded.
My grades have been slipping and she wants me to study more and spend more time at home.
Because she is a mean woman.
I've been sick.
I had the flu.
Too many people have the flu right now and she doesn't want me getting sick.
I have to babysit my siblings.
