I didn't do my chores.
I'm grounded.
My grades have been slipping and she wants me to study more and spend more time at home.
I'm in trouble for staying out to late.
I have a few projects that I have to focus on for school.
Frankly, she doesn't like me spending time with you.
I had the flu.
Too many people have the flu right now and she doesn't want me getting sick.
