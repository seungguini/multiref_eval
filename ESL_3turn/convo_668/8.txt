I'm grounded.
My grades have been slipping and she wants me to study more and spend more time at home.
I've been sick.
Frankly, she doesn't like me spending time with you.
I had the flu.
My family is coming over.
Too many people have the flu right now and she doesn't want me getting sick.
I have to babysit my siblings.
