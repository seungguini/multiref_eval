I failed my last english exam.
I didn't do my chores.
My grades have been slipping and she wants me to study more and spend more time at home.
Because she is a mean woman.
I'm in trouble for staying out to late.
Frankly, she doesn't like me spending time with you.
I had the flu.
I have to babysit my siblings.
