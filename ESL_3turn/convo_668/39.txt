I failed my last english exam.
I didn't do my chores.
I'm grounded.
Because she is a mean woman.
I have a few projects that I have to focus on for school.
Frankly, she doesn't like me spending time with you.
My family is coming over.
Too many people have the flu right now and she doesn't want me getting sick.
