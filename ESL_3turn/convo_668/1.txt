I'm grounded.
I'm grounded.
My grades have been slipping and she wants me to study more and spend more time at home.
I'm in trouble for staying out to late.
I have a few projects that I have to focus on for school.
Frankly, she doesn't like me spending time with you.
My family is coming over.
Too many people have the flu right now and she doesn't want me getting sick.
