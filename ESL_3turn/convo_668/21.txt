I failed my last english exam.
My grades have been slipping and she wants me to study more and spend more time at home.
I'm in trouble for staying out to late.
Frankly, she doesn't like me spending time with you.
I had the flu.
My family is coming over.
Too many people have the flu right now and she doesn't want me getting sick.
I have to babysit my siblings.
