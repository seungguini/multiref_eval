I failed my last english exam.
I didn't do my chores.
I'm grounded.
My grades have been slipping and she wants me to study more and spend more time at home.
I'm in trouble for staying out to late.
Frankly, she doesn't like me spending time with you.
My family is coming over.
I have to babysit my siblings.
