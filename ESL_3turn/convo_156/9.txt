i'm worried my classes are too hard
It's a very big school and there are a lot of people.
What if I'm not in any classes with my friends?
joey next door told me that there are bullies that lock you in closets
I have anxiety
i heard that the teachers are mean there
I don't know
what if my teacher doesn't like me
