Being a freshman
It's a very big school and there are a lot of people.
What if no one wants to sit with me at lunch?
I don't know anyone
What if I'm not in any classes with my friends?
joey next door told me that there are bullies that lock you in closets
i heard that the teachers are mean there
It's all new to me
