i'm worried my classes are too hard
Being a freshman
It's a very big school and there are a lot of people.
What if no one wants to sit with me at lunch?
i'm afraid of the big kids
I don't know anyone
I think the classes will be really hard.
What if I'm not in any classes with my friends?
joey next door told me that there are bullies that lock you in closets
I have anxiety
i heard that the teachers are mean there
I don't know
what if my teacher doesn't like me
It's all new to me
