i'm worried my classes are too hard
Being a freshman
What if no one wants to sit with me at lunch?
What if I'm not in any classes with my friends?
joey next door told me that there are bullies that lock you in closets
I have anxiety
i heard that the teachers are mean there
what if my teacher doesn't like me
