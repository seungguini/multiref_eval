i'm worried my classes are too hard
It's a very big school and there are a lot of people.
i'm afraid of the big kids
What if I'm not in any classes with my friends?
joey next door told me that there are bullies that lock you in closets
I don't know
what if my teacher doesn't like me
It's all new to me
