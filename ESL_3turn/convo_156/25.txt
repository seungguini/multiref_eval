i'm worried my classes are too hard
It's a very big school and there are a lot of people.
I don't know anyone
I think the classes will be really hard.
What if I'm not in any classes with my friends?
joey next door told me that there are bullies that lock you in closets
i heard that the teachers are mean there
what if my teacher doesn't like me
