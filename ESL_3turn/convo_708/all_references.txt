Do you think we could find a recipe for something like that?
I wonder if I can get the recipe.
It was my favorite.
It really was!
You should make chocolate cake more often.
I'm allergic to nuts, but it looks delicious.
I enjoy chocolate very much.
I love desserts!

I have such a bad sweet tooth!
I think it might have had spices in it.
It was so moist.
It would have been even better with a cocktail.
I loved the frosting.
