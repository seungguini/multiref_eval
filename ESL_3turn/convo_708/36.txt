Do you think we could find a recipe for something like that?
I wonder if I can get the recipe.
I'm allergic to nuts, but it looks delicious.
I love desserts!
The frosting was nice and rich but not too sweet.
I think it might have had spices in it.
It would have been even better with a cocktail.
I loved the frosting.
