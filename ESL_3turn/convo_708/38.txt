Do you think we could find a recipe for something like that?
It was my favorite.
You should make chocolate cake more often.
I enjoy chocolate very much.
The frosting was nice and rich but not too sweet.
I have such a bad sweet tooth!
It would have been even better with a cocktail.
I loved the frosting.
