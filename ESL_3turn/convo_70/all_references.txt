I have a better idea. Let's go see a movie.
That sounds good.
Sure, I do.
No, I'm avoiding alcohol.
I pretty much stopped drinking. I thought you knew that.
Let's go.
Nah, I think I'll pass.
No thank you. I'm sober now.
Sounds like fun! I'll grab my coat and call a taxi.
Yes. Give me a few minutes to get ready.
Yeah, where did you want to go?
Sure, who has some good drink specials?
I'm pretty tired. Maybe next time.
