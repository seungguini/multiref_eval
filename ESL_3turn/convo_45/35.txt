I really liked the fondue.
I loved the strawberry shortcake.
I think it's the best I've ever had.
I should have tried a bite of your cake.
I want to try that next time.
It definitely looked delicious.
I'm so glad that we decided to share it.
I'm so happy that I convinced you to get dessert with me!
