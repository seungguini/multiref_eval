We should come back here for grandma's birthday.
I'm going to have to tell my sister about this place. She'll love it.
I loved the strawberry shortcake.
You finished the whole thing!
I should have tried a bite of your cake.
I want to try that next time.
I don't love chocolate so I'm not sure if I would have liked that cake.
I'm so glad that we decided to share it.
