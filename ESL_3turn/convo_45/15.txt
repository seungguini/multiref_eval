We should come back here for grandma's birthday.
I'm going to have to tell my sister about this place. She'll love it.
I think it's the best I've ever had.
I should have tried a bite of your cake.
I don't love chocolate so I'm not sure if I would have liked that cake.
It definitely looked delicious.
I'm so glad that we decided to share it.
I'm so happy that I convinced you to get dessert with me!
