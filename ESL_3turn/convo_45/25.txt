I really liked the fondue.
We should come back here for grandma's birthday.
I think it's the best I've ever had.
You finished the whole thing!
I should have tried a bite of your cake.
I don't love chocolate so I'm not sure if I would have liked that cake.
It definitely looked delicious.
I'm so glad that we decided to share it.
