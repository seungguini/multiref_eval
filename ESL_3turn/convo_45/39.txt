We should come back here for grandma's birthday.
I'm going to have to tell my sister about this place. She'll love it.
I loved the strawberry shortcake.
It looked great.
I think it's the best I've ever had.
You finished the whole thing!
I'm so glad that we decided to share it.
I'm so happy that I convinced you to get dessert with me!
