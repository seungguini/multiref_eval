I really should, but I've been procrastinating.
Not interested,
I've heard too many bad things about it.
I'm not into the whole social media thing.
I don't want one.
It's a waste of time.
It's against my religion.
I don't like posting pictures of myself.
I am not interested in Facebook.
I don't need it
I'm afraid I'll get fired from my job.
It is addicting
