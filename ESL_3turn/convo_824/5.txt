Why don't you do something else?
Do you like working with kids?
Yeah I don't like to hang around kids.
Are the kids hard to handle?
Time to grow up and get a real job.
Maybe you should check out a job listing site for ideas of what to do.
Why don't you like being a babysitter?
I think that would be a good job?
