Why don't you do something else?
Yeah I don't like to hang around kids.
Time to grow up and get a real job.
Maybe you should check out a job listing site for ideas of what to do.
Oh I like babysitting!
Why don't you like being a babysitter?
Do you not make good money?
I think that would be a good job?
