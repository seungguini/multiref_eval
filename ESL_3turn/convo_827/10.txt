Ask someone for help.
Ask at the customer service desk
Let's ask the checkout girl if she can help us.
Can you go to another store?
They could be out right now.
I'm not sure where it would be then?
That's odd, it was there last time I shopped.
We are going to have to go to the store across the street.
