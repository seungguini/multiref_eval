Ok. Just get Basmati instead.
Ask someone for help.
Let's ask the checkout girl if she can help us.
They could be out right now.
I'm not sure where it would be then?
That's odd, it was there last time I shopped.
Maybe they don't carry it at this store?
We are going to have to go to the store across the street.
