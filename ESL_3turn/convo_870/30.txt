We've never spoken before.
But I barely know you at all.
That doesn't mean I know you.
I've never seen you in that class.
My car will be too full because I'm going to be dropping my friends over.
I'd like to get to know you better first.
Sorry, but I only give rides to friends.
Do you sit behind me?
