I remember now, sure get in then.
We've never spoken before.
That's where I know you from.
But I barely know you at all.
That doesn't mean I know you.
I've never seen you in that class.
I suppose so.
My car will be too full because I'm going to be dropping my friends over.
I'd like to get to know you better first.
Is your name Wayne?
I'm sorry, I have completely forgotten.
Aren't you Tom?
Sorry, but I only give rides to friends.
Do you sit behind me?
