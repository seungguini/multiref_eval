Someone hit me.
A shopping cart hit me.
Someone hit my car with their shopping cart.
I wasn't looking when I was backing out.
I hit something while backing out.
Someone door-dinged me!
I didn't see what happened.
My friend did this!
I got backed into while I was in the store
A man was backing up his truck and wasn't paying attention.
It was a hit and run.
I opened my door and hit a light pole.
