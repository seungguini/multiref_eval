I WILL BUY ANYTHING
Nothing, it was super lame.
I didn't see anything I liked.
A few things.  Cleaning supplies.
DID U GONE BEFORE?
So much food, dude.
I bought some toys for the grandkids.
Supplies to make that gift for Laura's graduation.
Just some streamers for the party.
Just a few things for around the house.
Some vegetables.  I need to eat healthier.
I bought some drinks and snacks for the picnic.
Nothing important.  Some snacks.
I picked up some toothpaste.
Halloween decorations for the house.
