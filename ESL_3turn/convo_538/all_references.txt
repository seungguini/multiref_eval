It's just rude.
It's my pet peeve.
You are eating it wrong.
It looks gross.
You're going to get it all over the place.
You don't eat rice with chopsticks.
Its more traditional if you do it this way.
It doesn't look right.
You're making a mess.
You look funny doing it that way.
People are looking.
Just stop people are looking at you weird.
Please don't embarrass me.
Just use the fork, its okay.
