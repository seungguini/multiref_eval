Y U DIDNT VOTE FOR TRUMP
The Green Party candidate.
Only the best candidate for president.
He's nobody.
NO I VOTE FOR RALPH
Apparently not the next president.
He's a great guy from my hometown.
No one knows him.
He's my uncle!
He supports pro-choice and gay marriage.
He's not the obvious choice.
I don't know, but I liked his signs.
He's a member of the independent party.
He's kind of obscure.
A candidate with the same views as me.
He's so religious freak.
