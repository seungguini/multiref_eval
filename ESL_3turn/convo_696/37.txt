We just ate. Auntie said we'll get cramps.
We have to wait for them to clean the pool.
They're still cleaning the pool.
We have to wait for the pool to open.
The water is too cold, we have to wait until the sun is higher.
We have to wait a hour after eating before we can swim.
We have to do our chores forst.
We are not supposed to meet our friends till later.
