We just ate. Auntie said we'll get cramps.
They're still cleaning the pool.
We have to wait for the pool to open.
The water is too cold, we have to wait until the sun is higher.
The pool is not open yet.
We have to do our chores forst.
It is lightning, we have to wait till the storm clears.
We are not supposed to meet our friends till later.
