We just ate and don't want cramps.
We have to wait for them to clean the pool.
The pool isn't open yet.
They're still cleaning the pool.
We have to wait for the pool to open.
We have to do our chores forst.
It is lightning, we have to wait till the storm clears.
We are not supposed to meet our friends till later.
