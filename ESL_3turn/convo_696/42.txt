We just ate. Auntie said we'll get cramps.
We just ate food and we have to let it digest.
We have to wait for our ride to pick us up.
The water is too cold, we have to wait until the sun is higher.
The pool is not open yet.
We have to wait a hour after eating before we can swim.
We have to do our chores forst.
It is lightning, we have to wait till the storm clears.
