We just ate food and we have to let it digest.
We have to wait for them to clean the pool.
The pool isn't open yet.
We have to wait for our ride to pick us up.
The pool is not open yet.
We have to do our chores forst.
It is lightning, we have to wait till the storm clears.
We are not supposed to meet our friends till later.
