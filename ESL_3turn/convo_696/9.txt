We just ate and don't want cramps.
We just ate. Auntie said we'll get cramps.
We just ate food and we have to let it digest.
We have to wait for them to clean the pool.
We have to wait for the pool to open.
The pool is not open yet.
We have to wait a hour after eating before we can swim.
It is lightning, we have to wait till the storm clears.
