We just ate and don't want cramps.
We just ate. Auntie said we'll get cramps.
We just ate food and we have to let it digest.
The pool isn't open yet.
They're still cleaning the pool.
We have to wait a hour after eating before we can swim.
We have to do our chores forst.
It is lightning, we have to wait till the storm clears.
