We just ate and don't want cramps.
We just ate food and we have to let it digest.
We have to wait for them to clean the pool.
They're still cleaning the pool.
We have to wait for our ride to pick us up.
We have to do our chores forst.
It is lightning, we have to wait till the storm clears.
We are not supposed to meet our friends till later.
