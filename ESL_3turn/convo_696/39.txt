We just ate. Auntie said we'll get cramps.
We have to wait for them to clean the pool.
The pool isn't open yet.
We have to wait for our ride to pick us up.
We have to wait for the pool to open.
The water is too cold, we have to wait until the sun is higher.
We have to wait a hour after eating before we can swim.
We have to do our chores forst.
