We just ate. Auntie said we'll get cramps.
The pool isn't open yet.
They're still cleaning the pool.
We have to wait for the pool to open.
The water is too cold, we have to wait until the sun is higher.
We have to wait a hour after eating before we can swim.
We have to do our chores forst.
It is lightning, we have to wait till the storm clears.
