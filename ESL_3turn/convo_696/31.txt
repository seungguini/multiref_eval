We just ate food and we have to let it digest.
The pool isn't open yet.
They're still cleaning the pool.
We have to wait for our ride to pick us up.
The water is too cold, we have to wait until the sun is higher.
The pool is not open yet.
It is lightning, we have to wait till the storm clears.
We are not supposed to meet our friends till later.
