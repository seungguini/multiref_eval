We just ate food and we have to let it digest.
We have to wait for them to clean the pool.
The pool isn't open yet.
They're still cleaning the pool.
We have to wait for the pool to open.
The water is too cold, we have to wait until the sun is higher.
We have to do our chores forst.
It is lightning, we have to wait till the storm clears.
