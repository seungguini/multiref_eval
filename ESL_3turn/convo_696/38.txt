We just ate. Auntie said we'll get cramps.
We just ate food and we have to let it digest.
They're still cleaning the pool.
We have to wait for our ride to pick us up.
The pool is not open yet.
We have to wait a hour after eating before we can swim.
It is lightning, we have to wait till the storm clears.
We are not supposed to meet our friends till later.
