We just ate and don't want cramps.
We just ate food and we have to let it digest.
We have to wait for them to clean the pool.
They're still cleaning the pool.
The water is too cold, we have to wait until the sun is higher.
We have to wait a hour after eating before we can swim.
It is lightning, we have to wait till the storm clears.
We are not supposed to meet our friends till later.
