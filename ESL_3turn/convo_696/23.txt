We just ate and don't want cramps.
We have to wait for them to clean the pool.
They're still cleaning the pool.
We have to wait for our ride to pick us up.
We have to wait for the pool to open.
The pool is not open yet.
We have to do our chores forst.
It is lightning, we have to wait till the storm clears.
