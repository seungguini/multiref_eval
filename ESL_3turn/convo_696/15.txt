We just ate and don't want cramps.
We just ate food and we have to let it digest.
We have to wait for them to clean the pool.
They're still cleaning the pool.
We have to wait for our ride to pick us up.
We have to wait for the pool to open.
The water is too cold, we have to wait until the sun is higher.
The pool is not open yet.
