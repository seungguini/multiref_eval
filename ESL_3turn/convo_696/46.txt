We just ate and don't want cramps.
The pool isn't open yet.
They're still cleaning the pool.
We have to wait for the pool to open.
We have to wait a hour after eating before we can swim.
We have to do our chores forst.
It is lightning, we have to wait till the storm clears.
We are not supposed to meet our friends till later.
