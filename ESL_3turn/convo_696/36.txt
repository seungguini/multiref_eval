We just ate and don't want cramps.
We just ate food and we have to let it digest.
The pool isn't open yet.
We have to wait for our ride to pick us up.
We have to wait for the pool to open.
We have to do our chores forst.
It is lightning, we have to wait till the storm clears.
We are not supposed to meet our friends till later.
