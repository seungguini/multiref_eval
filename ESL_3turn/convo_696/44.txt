We just ate. Auntie said we'll get cramps.
We just ate food and we have to let it digest.
They're still cleaning the pool.
We have to wait for our ride to pick us up.
We have to wait for the pool to open.
The pool is not open yet.
We have to do our chores forst.
It is lightning, we have to wait till the storm clears.
