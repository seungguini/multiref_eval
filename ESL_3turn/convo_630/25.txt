I will get the manager for you right away.
What time was the delivery supposed to be?
Could I have your account number to look up the sale?
No, it didn't and I'm upset because I waited all day for it to arrive.
Do you need to reschedule the delivery?
How may I help you with the delivery appointment?
Do you have your sale receipt.
Is there a problem? Will you not be home?
