Let me check your paper to verify if it was corrected properly.
Most people would not say anything, thank you for catching that.
I didn't make any mistake grading those papers.
Why don't you want a better grade?
Let me correct that, I'm sorry.
Are you sure?
It's one question, we'll just leave it as is.
I don't think you're correct.
