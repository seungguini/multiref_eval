Thank you for bringing that to my attention.
That's very honest of you.
Let me check your paper to verify if it was corrected properly.
It's not going to change your grade.
I didn't make any mistake grading those papers.
Why don't you want a better grade?
Don't worry about it.
I don't think you're correct.
