Thank you for bringing that to my attention.
You were honest, I'll let that one slip.
That's very honest of you.
Let me check your paper to verify if it was corrected properly.
Most people would not say anything, thank you for catching that.
Thank you for being honest, I'll fix the error.
It's not going to change your grade.
I didn't make any mistake grading those papers.
Why don't you want a better grade?
Don't worry about it.
Let me correct that, I'm sorry.
Are you sure?
It's one question, we'll just leave it as is.
I don't think you're correct.
