Thank you for bringing that to my attention.
Let me check your paper to verify if it was corrected properly.
Thank you for being honest, I'll fix the error.
It's not going to change your grade.
I didn't make any mistake grading those papers.
Why don't you want a better grade?
Let me correct that, I'm sorry.
It's one question, we'll just leave it as is.
