You're mean.
They're humans too who get nervous and intimidated like the rest of us.
But don't you feel kind of bad for them?
It's hilarious.
True. Especially in their fancy dresses.
You're right, it is funny.
I guess so
they are clumsy just like us.
Why is it funny? Just because theyre famous?
Shit happens.
That's not very nice.
They trip too.
If you say so.
They have accidents too.
