Yeah, it looks like it.
They should be busy about us.
I suppose so, but I think I'm going to ask our waiter what's going on.
Yeah, I think you're right.
I'm about to leave in the next ten minutes.
I don't care if they're busy. This wait is getting to be ridiculous.
I'm sure he forgot to ring it in.
You should ask for the meal to be discounted for comped.
