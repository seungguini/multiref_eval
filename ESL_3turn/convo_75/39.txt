Or maybe they forgot about us.
Yeah, it looks like it.
They're not busy, there's only two other tables.
I suppose so, but I think I'm going to ask our waiter what's going on.
They probably are very busy.
I don't care if they're busy. This wait is getting to be ridiculous.
I'm sure he forgot to ring it in.
You should ask for the meal to be discounted for comped.
