Or maybe they forgot about us.
They should be busy about us.
They're not busy, there's only two other tables.
I suppose so, but I think I'm going to ask our waiter what's going on.
They probably are very busy.
Yeah, I think you're right.
I don't care if they're busy. This wait is getting to be ridiculous.
I'm going to flag down the waiter to ask where it is.
