Yeah, it looks like it.
They should be busy about us.
They're not busy, there's only two other tables.
I suppose so, but I think I'm going to ask our waiter what's going on.
They probably are very busy.
I'm surprised. They're usually dead at this hour.
I'm going to flag down the waiter to ask where it is.
I'm sure he forgot to ring it in.
