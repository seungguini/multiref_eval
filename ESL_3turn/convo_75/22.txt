Yeah, it looks like it.
They should be busy about us.
They're not busy, there's only two other tables.
I suppose so, but I think I'm going to ask our waiter what's going on.
They probably are very busy.
Yeah, I think you're right.
I'm surprised. They're usually dead at this hour.
You should ask for the meal to be discounted for comped.
