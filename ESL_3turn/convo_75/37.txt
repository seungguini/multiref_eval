Or maybe they forgot about us.
Yeah, it looks like it.
They're not busy, there's only two other tables.
They probably are very busy.
I don't care if they're busy. This wait is getting to be ridiculous.
I'm surprised. They're usually dead at this hour.
I'm going to flag down the waiter to ask where it is.
You should ask for the meal to be discounted for comped.
