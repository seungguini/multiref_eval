Yeah, it looks like it.
They should be busy about us.
I'm about to leave in the next ten minutes.
I don't care if they're busy. This wait is getting to be ridiculous.
I'm surprised. They're usually dead at this hour.
I'm going to flag down the waiter to ask where it is.
I'm sure he forgot to ring it in.
You should ask for the meal to be discounted for comped.
