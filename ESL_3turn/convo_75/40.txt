Or maybe they forgot about us.
They should be busy about us.
They're not busy, there's only two other tables.
They probably are very busy.
Yeah, I think you're right.
I don't care if they're busy. This wait is getting to be ridiculous.
I'm going to flag down the waiter to ask where it is.
I'm sure he forgot to ring it in.
