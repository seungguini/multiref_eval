Yeah, it looks like it.
They should be busy about us.
I suppose so, but I think I'm going to ask our waiter what's going on.
They probably are very busy.
Yeah, I think you're right.
I'm about to leave in the next ten minutes.
I'm surprised. They're usually dead at this hour.
You should ask for the meal to be discounted for comped.
