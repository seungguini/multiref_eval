Yeah, it looks like it.
I suppose so, but I think I'm going to ask our waiter what's going on.
They probably are very busy.
I'm about to leave in the next ten minutes.
I don't care if they're busy. This wait is getting to be ridiculous.
I'm surprised. They're usually dead at this hour.
I'm sure he forgot to ring it in.
You should ask for the meal to be discounted for comped.
