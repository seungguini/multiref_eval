Yeah, it looks like it.
They should be busy about us.
I suppose so, but I think I'm going to ask our waiter what's going on.
They probably are very busy.
Yeah, I think you're right.
I'm about to leave in the next ten minutes.
I'm going to flag down the waiter to ask where it is.
I'm sure he forgot to ring it in.
