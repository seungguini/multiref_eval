Or maybe they forgot about us.
They should be busy about us.
I suppose so, but I think I'm going to ask our waiter what's going on.
They probably are very busy.
I'm about to leave in the next ten minutes.
I don't care if they're busy. This wait is getting to be ridiculous.
I'm surprised. They're usually dead at this hour.
I'm going to flag down the waiter to ask where it is.
