Or maybe they forgot about us.
Yeah, it looks like it.
They're not busy, there's only two other tables.
They probably are very busy.
I'm about to leave in the next ten minutes.
I don't care if they're busy. This wait is getting to be ridiculous.
I'm going to flag down the waiter to ask where it is.
I'm sure he forgot to ring it in.
