Or maybe they forgot about us.
Yeah, it looks like it.
They're not busy, there's only two other tables.
I suppose so, but I think I'm going to ask our waiter what's going on.
Yeah, I think you're right.
I'm about to leave in the next ten minutes.
I'm going to flag down the waiter to ask where it is.
I'm sure he forgot to ring it in.
