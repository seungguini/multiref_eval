Yeah, it looks like it.
They should be busy about us.
They're not busy, there's only two other tables.
I suppose so, but I think I'm going to ask our waiter what's going on.
I'm about to leave in the next ten minutes.
I'm surprised. They're usually dead at this hour.
I'm going to flag down the waiter to ask where it is.
You should ask for the meal to be discounted for comped.
