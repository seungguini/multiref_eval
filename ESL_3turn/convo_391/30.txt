How'd you manage that?
That's terrible! How did that happen?
How did you break your leg?
Oh, no. Did you know the elevator is right over there?
What were you doing when the accident happened?
I'm sorry. If you'll just lean on me I can help you up the steps.
Are you still in pain?
Did you break it skiing?
