Why don't you just ask him?
I can ask around and see if anyone has his address.
Oh how sweet.
Oh when is the party?
I think I saw him earlier.
You should try messaging him and asking.
That's nice, I can look it up for you.
Did you ask Sandy?
John has a son.
I can text him.
Oh, that's so sweet!
Do you want me to call him?
That sounds like fun!
Maybe send him a Facebook message?
