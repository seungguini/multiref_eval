She is holding her chest.
She is complaining of chest pain and pain in her left arm.
She's unconscious and on the floor.
She asked me to call and say this.
She is having severe chest pains.
She just collapsed onto the ground! Send an ambulance now!
She's not breathing!
She said her head hurt and she just dropped to the floor!
