Well, that's most buses though. Just takes patience.
That's why you have to leave early to give yourself time as it takes multiple stops.
Maybe you should look into other modes of transportation.
And it stinks.
You're too slow.
Maybe there's another bus line that has less stops so it can be quicker.
Yeah, that's true.
No it's not!
