So leave earlier and take your time.
It's faster than your mom's car!
Well, that's most buses though. Just takes patience.
Why was it slow? A lot of people on the bus or too many stops?
And number two?
Maybe you should look into other modes of transportation.
And it stinks.
Maybe there's another bus line that has less stops so it can be quicker.
