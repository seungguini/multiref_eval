So leave earlier and take your time.
Well, that's most buses though. Just takes patience.
That's why you have to leave early to give yourself time as it takes multiple stops.
Traffic is all the same at this time.
Why was it slow? A lot of people on the bus or too many stops?
And number two?
And it stinks.
Maybe there's another bus line that has less stops so it can be quicker.
