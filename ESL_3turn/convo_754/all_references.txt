I was 21 year old.
When I was 16.
I think I was 19.
In middle school, I was really young.
When I was in 7th grade I must have been 13.
At my junior prom.
Well, I was 12 but it doesn't really count - it was a dare.
I haven't kissed anyone either.
A whle ago in intermediate. I don't even remember her name.
