Freedom!
I am excited to start college.
No, just real work.
Yeah, but college could be worse.
No more boring classes.
I can't wait to get a full time job and make some money!
But you have to get a job.
I've been looking forward to it so much.
I can finally get away from all these people.
We can sleep late!
Life will be so much better.
I actually liked doing homework.
That's hard to imagine.
Please say that again.
