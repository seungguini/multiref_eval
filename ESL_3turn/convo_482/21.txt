Hello Mr Jones.  How can i help you.
Oh hello I'm so glad we were able to connect.
What can I do for you, Mr. Jones?
I have never heard of the ABC company.
Mr. Jones, I have already told you that I never want to hear from the ABC Company again.
Mr. Fremont from your company already called me.
I'm sorry what does your company do again?
