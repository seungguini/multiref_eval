Hello Mr Jones.  How can i help you.
Oh hello I'm so glad we were able to connect.
Hello, how can I help you?
I was under the impression you would be calling me the other day.
Mr. Jones, I have already told you that I never want to hear from the ABC Company again.
Yes, what is this about? I'm busy.
Mr. Fremont from your company already called me.
I'm sorry what does your company do again?
