Hello Mr Jones.  How can i help you.
Oh hello I'm so glad we were able to connect.
Hello, how can I help you?
I was under the impression you would be calling me the other day.
Mr. Jones, I have already told you that I never want to hear from the ABC Company again.
Yes, what is this about? I'm busy.
I'm sorry what does your company do again?
Mr. Jones, may I call you back in several minutes?
