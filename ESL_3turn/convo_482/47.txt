What can I do for you, Mr. Jones?
Hello, how can I help you?
I have never heard of the ABC company.
I was under the impression you would be calling me the other day.
Mr. Jones, I have already told you that I never want to hear from the ABC Company again.
Yes, what is this about? I'm busy.
What do you sell.
I'm sorry what does your company do again?
