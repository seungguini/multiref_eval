What can I do for you, Mr. Jones?
Hello, how can I help you?
I have never heard of the ABC company.
Mr. Jones, I have already told you that I never want to hear from the ABC Company again.
Yes, what is this about? I'm busy.
Mr. Fremont from your company already called me.
I'm sorry what does your company do again?
Mr. Jones, may I call you back in several minutes?
