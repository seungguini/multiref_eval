Hello Mr Jones.  How can i help you.
Hello, how can I help you?
I have never heard of the ABC company.
I was under the impression you would be calling me the other day.
What do you sell.
Mr. Fremont from your company already called me.
I'm sorry what does your company do again?
Mr. Jones, may I call you back in several minutes?
