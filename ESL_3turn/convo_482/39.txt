Oh hello I'm so glad we were able to connect.
What can I do for you, Mr. Jones?
Hello, how can I help you?
I have never heard of the ABC company.
I was under the impression you would be calling me the other day.
Yes, what is this about? I'm busy.
Mr. Fremont from your company already called me.
Mr. Jones, may I call you back in several minutes?
