Hello Mr Jones.  How can i help you.
What can I do for you, Mr. Jones?
I have never heard of the ABC company.
I was under the impression you would be calling me the other day.
Mr. Jones, I have already told you that I never want to hear from the ABC Company again.
What do you sell.
Mr. Fremont from your company already called me.
I'm sorry what does your company do again?
