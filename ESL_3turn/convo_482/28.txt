Hello Mr Jones.  How can i help you.
Oh hello I'm so glad we were able to connect.
I have never heard of the ABC company.
Mr. Jones, I have already told you that I never want to hear from the ABC Company again.
Yes, what is this about? I'm busy.
What do you sell.
I'm sorry what does your company do again?
Mr. Jones, may I call you back in several minutes?
