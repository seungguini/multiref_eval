Oh hello I'm so glad we were able to connect.
What can I do for you, Mr. Jones?
Hello, how can I help you?
Mr. Jones, I have already told you that I never want to hear from the ABC Company again.
Yes, what is this about? I'm busy.
What do you sell.
I'm sorry what does your company do again?
Mr. Jones, may I call you back in several minutes?
