Hello Mr Jones.  How can i help you.
Oh hello I'm so glad we were able to connect.
What can I do for you, Mr. Jones?
Hello, how can I help you?
I have never heard of the ABC company.
I was under the impression you would be calling me the other day.
Mr. Jones, I have already told you that I never want to hear from the ABC Company again.
Yes, what is this about? I'm busy.
What do you sell.
Mr. Fremont from your company already called me.
I'm sorry what does your company do again?
Mr. Jones, may I call you back in several minutes?
