I know! Did you hear about that jogger that got kidnapped!
Why don't you take your dog with you?
Stop talking like that. You're making me nervous!
That's a good idea. Safety in numbers.
We just need to be cautious and pay attention.
I take my dog with me if I have to go out at night.
God is my protection.
Next time we'll take Uber, what do you think?
