Why don't you take your dog with you?
Stop talking like that. You're making me nervous!
I carry mace, it makes me feel safer.
That's a good idea. Safety in numbers.
Just stay where it's brightly lit and you should be fine.
God is my protection.
Invest in a body alarm.
Next time we'll take Uber, what do you think?
