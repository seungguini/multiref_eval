Why don't you take your dog with you?
I carry mace, it makes me feel safer.
You should be very careful. You never know.
We just need to be cautious and pay attention.
Just stay where it's brightly lit and you should be fine.
Yeah, but there are lots of streetlights and we only need to go a block or so.
I would feel better if there was a group of us instead of just us two.
Next time we'll take Uber, what do you think?
