I know! Did you hear about that jogger that got kidnapped!
Why don't you take your dog with you?
That's why I always go out in groups.
I carry mace, it makes me feel safer.
You should be very careful. You never know.
I take my dog with me if I have to go out at night.
Just stay where it's brightly lit and you should be fine.
Yeah, but there are lots of streetlights and we only need to go a block or so.
