Why don't you take your dog with you?
Stop talking like that. You're making me nervous!
You should be very careful. You never know.
That's a good idea. Safety in numbers.
I take my dog with me if I have to go out at night.
Just stay where it's brightly lit and you should be fine.
I would feel better if there was a group of us instead of just us two.
Next time we'll take Uber, what do you think?
