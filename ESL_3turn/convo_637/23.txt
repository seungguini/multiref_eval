Stop talking like that. You're making me nervous!
I carry mace, it makes me feel safer.
That's a good idea. Safety in numbers.
I take my dog with me if I have to go out at night.
Just stay where it's brightly lit and you should be fine.
Yeah, but there are lots of streetlights and we only need to go a block or so.
I would feel better if there was a group of us instead of just us two.
Next time we'll take Uber, what do you think?
