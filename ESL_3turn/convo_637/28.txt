I know! Did you hear about that jogger that got kidnapped!
Stop talking like that. You're making me nervous!
You should be very careful. You never know.
That's a good idea. Safety in numbers.
We just need to be cautious and pay attention.
I take my dog with me if I have to go out at night.
Just stay where it's brightly lit and you should be fine.
God is my protection.
