I know! Did you hear about that jogger that got kidnapped!
Why don't you take your dog with you?
That's a good idea. Safety in numbers.
We just need to be cautious and pay attention.
Just stay where it's brightly lit and you should be fine.
Yeah, but there are lots of streetlights and we only need to go a block or so.
Invest in a body alarm.
I would feel better if there was a group of us instead of just us two.
