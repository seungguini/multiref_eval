I know! Did you hear about that jogger that got kidnapped!
I carry mace, it makes me feel safer.
You should be very careful. You never know.
That's a good idea. Safety in numbers.
I take my dog with me if I have to go out at night.
Yeah, but there are lots of streetlights and we only need to go a block or so.
God is my protection.
I would feel better if there was a group of us instead of just us two.
