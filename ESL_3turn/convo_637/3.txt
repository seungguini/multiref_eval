I know! Did you hear about that jogger that got kidnapped!
That's why I always go out in groups.
Stop talking like that. You're making me nervous!
I carry mace, it makes me feel safer.
I take my dog with me if I have to go out at night.
Just stay where it's brightly lit and you should be fine.
Invest in a body alarm.
Next time we'll take Uber, what do you think?
