I know! Did you hear about that jogger that got kidnapped!
Why don't you take your dog with you?
That's why I always go out in groups.
I carry mace, it makes me feel safer.
We just need to be cautious and pay attention.
I take my dog with me if I have to go out at night.
Invest in a body alarm.
I would feel better if there was a group of us instead of just us two.
