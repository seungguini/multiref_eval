I know! Did you hear about that jogger that got kidnapped!
Why don't you take your dog with you?
That's why I always go out in groups.
You should be very careful. You never know.
That's a good idea. Safety in numbers.
Just stay where it's brightly lit and you should be fine.
Yeah, but there are lots of streetlights and we only need to go a block or so.
I would feel better if there was a group of us instead of just us two.
