I know! Did you hear about that jogger that got kidnapped!
Stop talking like that. You're making me nervous!
I carry mace, it makes me feel safer.
You should be very careful. You never know.
That's a good idea. Safety in numbers.
Just stay where it's brightly lit and you should be fine.
Yeah, but there are lots of streetlights and we only need to go a block or so.
God is my protection.
