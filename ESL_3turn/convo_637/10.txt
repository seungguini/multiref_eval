I know! Did you hear about that jogger that got kidnapped!
Why don't you take your dog with you?
Stop talking like that. You're making me nervous!
You should be very careful. You never know.
Just stay where it's brightly lit and you should be fine.
Yeah, but there are lots of streetlights and we only need to go a block or so.
God is my protection.
Next time we'll take Uber, what do you think?
