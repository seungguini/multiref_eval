Why don't you take your dog with you?
That's why I always go out in groups.
Stop talking like that. You're making me nervous!
You should be very careful. You never know.
We just need to be cautious and pay attention.
Just stay where it's brightly lit and you should be fine.
God is my protection.
Next time we'll take Uber, what do you think?
