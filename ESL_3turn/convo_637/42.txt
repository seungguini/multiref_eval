Why don't you take your dog with you?
That's why I always go out in groups.
I carry mace, it makes me feel safer.
Just stay where it's brightly lit and you should be fine.
God is my protection.
Invest in a body alarm.
I would feel better if there was a group of us instead of just us two.
Next time we'll take Uber, what do you think?
