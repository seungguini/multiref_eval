Why don't you take your dog with you?
I carry mace, it makes me feel safer.
You should be very careful. You never know.
That's a good idea. Safety in numbers.
We just need to be cautious and pay attention.
I take my dog with me if I have to go out at night.
Just stay where it's brightly lit and you should be fine.
Next time we'll take Uber, what do you think?
