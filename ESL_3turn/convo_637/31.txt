I know! Did you hear about that jogger that got kidnapped!
That's why I always go out in groups.
I carry mace, it makes me feel safer.
That's a good idea. Safety in numbers.
We just need to be cautious and pay attention.
Invest in a body alarm.
I would feel better if there was a group of us instead of just us two.
Next time we'll take Uber, what do you think?
