Why don't you take your dog with you?
That's why I always go out in groups.
That's a good idea. Safety in numbers.
I take my dog with me if I have to go out at night.
Just stay where it's brightly lit and you should be fine.
Yeah, but there are lots of streetlights and we only need to go a block or so.
God is my protection.
Invest in a body alarm.
