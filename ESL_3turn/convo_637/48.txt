I know! Did you hear about that jogger that got kidnapped!
You should be very careful. You never know.
We just need to be cautious and pay attention.
Just stay where it's brightly lit and you should be fine.
Yeah, but there are lots of streetlights and we only need to go a block or so.
God is my protection.
I would feel better if there was a group of us instead of just us two.
Next time we'll take Uber, what do you think?
