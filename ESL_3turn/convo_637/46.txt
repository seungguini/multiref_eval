I know! Did you hear about that jogger that got kidnapped!
That's why I always go out in groups.
I carry mace, it makes me feel safer.
We just need to be cautious and pay attention.
I take my dog with me if I have to go out at night.
Yeah, but there are lots of streetlights and we only need to go a block or so.
Invest in a body alarm.
I would feel better if there was a group of us instead of just us two.
