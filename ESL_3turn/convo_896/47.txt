I was thinking of moving abroad and teaching.
I think I want to be a teacher.
I'm going to write a book.
I want to be an English professor.
I will teach at a university or college someday.
That's the same question my parents asked me.
There are lots of jobs you can do with a degree in English.
I plan to be a writer.
