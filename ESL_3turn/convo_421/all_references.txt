I don't want to tell you.
I forgot it at home!
I left it at home.
It's what I didn't do.
I forgot the presentation.
I left it on the bus!
I never made one.
You already know the answer to that.
The dog ate it for real.
You predicted it.
I spilled coffee on it on the way over.
It's your fault because you rushed me.
It tore when the wind caught it.
I even wrote it down.
