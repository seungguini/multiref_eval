Me too always on my chin.
Maybe you should go to the dermatologist and get some kind of medicine.
Why don't you try a raw honey and cinnamon scrub?
I feel your pain, I feel the same way.
You know that your diet can cause your face to break out.
Have you tried detoxing?
Have you tried the new cleaser from Clinique?
Don't touch them.
