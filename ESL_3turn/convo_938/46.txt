Me too always on my chin.
Maybe you should go to the dermatologist and get some kind of medicine.
Maybe it's your diet.
You know that your diet can cause your face to break out.
Have you tried detoxing?
Have you tried the new cleaser from Clinique?
Are you allergic to any types of food?
Don't touch them.
