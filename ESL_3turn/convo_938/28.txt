Maybe you should go to the dermatologist and get some kind of medicine.
Why don't you try a raw honey and cinnamon scrub?
Maybe it's your diet.
You know that your diet can cause your face to break out.
Have you tried the new cleaser from Clinique?
Are you allergic to any types of food?
Don't touch them.
