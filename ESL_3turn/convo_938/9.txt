Me too always on my chin.
Maybe you should go to the dermatologist and get some kind of medicine.
Why don't you try a raw honey and cinnamon scrub?
Maybe it's your diet.
I feel your pain, I feel the same way.
You know that your diet can cause your face to break out.
I have a cleanser that clears up my skin.
Don't touch them.
