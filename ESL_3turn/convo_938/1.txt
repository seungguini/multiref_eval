Me too always on my chin.
Maybe you should go to the dermatologist and get some kind of medicine.
Why don't you try a raw honey and cinnamon scrub?
Maybe it's your diet.
Have you tried detoxing?
Have you tried the new cleaser from Clinique?
I have a cleanser that clears up my skin.
Don't touch them.
