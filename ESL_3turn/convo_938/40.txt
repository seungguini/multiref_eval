Me too always on my chin.
Maybe you should go to the dermatologist and get some kind of medicine.
Why don't you try a raw honey and cinnamon scrub?
I feel your pain, I feel the same way.
Have you tried detoxing?
Have you tried the new cleaser from Clinique?
Don't touch them.
Try to cut down on the makeup.
