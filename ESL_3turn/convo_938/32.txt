Me too always on my chin.
Maybe you should go to the dermatologist and get some kind of medicine.
I feel your pain, I feel the same way.
You know that your diet can cause your face to break out.
Have you tried detoxing?
Are you allergic to any types of food?
I have a cleanser that clears up my skin.
Don't touch them.
