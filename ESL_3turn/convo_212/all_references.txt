Yes I don't like Warhol.
Yeah he makes some crazy pictures.
The one that was missing.  They found it.
You don't like Campbells Soup cans?
I've always found his art very cool.
Oh really?  I like him.
Andy Warhol is over rated.
He was a little different. I love his work.
Which one is it?
I heard Any Warhol was into boys.
I love how he just repeated the same picture over and over with different colors.
You don't know anything about the art world.
He's so weird.
Did you ever see his artwork of Marilyn Monroe?
Tell me what's going on.
Art sells.  It's all a bunch of bullshit.
