Yes I don't like Warhol.
Yeah he makes some crazy pictures.
I've always found his art very cool.
Oh really?  I like him.
Andy Warhol is over rated.
He was a little different. I love his work.
I love how he just repeated the same picture over and over with different colors.
You don't know anything about the art world.
