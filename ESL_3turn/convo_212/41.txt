Yes I don't like Warhol.
The one that was missing.  They found it.
Oh really?  I like him.
He was a little different. I love his work.
I heard Any Warhol was into boys.
I love how he just repeated the same picture over and over with different colors.
He's so weird.
Art sells.  It's all a bunch of bullshit.
