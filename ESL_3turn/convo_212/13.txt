Yes I don't like Warhol.
The one that was missing.  They found it.
I've always found his art very cool.
Which one is it?
I heard Any Warhol was into boys.
I love how he just repeated the same picture over and over with different colors.
You don't know anything about the art world.
Did you ever see his artwork of Marilyn Monroe?
