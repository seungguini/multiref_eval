Yeah he makes some crazy pictures.
I've always found his art very cool.
Oh really?  I like him.
Which one is it?
I love how he just repeated the same picture over and over with different colors.
Did you ever see his artwork of Marilyn Monroe?
Tell me what's going on.
Art sells.  It's all a bunch of bullshit.
