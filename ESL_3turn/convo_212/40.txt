Yes I don't like Warhol.
Yeah he makes some crazy pictures.
The one that was missing.  They found it.
You don't like Campbells Soup cans?
Oh really?  I like him.
I love how he just repeated the same picture over and over with different colors.
Did you ever see his artwork of Marilyn Monroe?
Art sells.  It's all a bunch of bullshit.
