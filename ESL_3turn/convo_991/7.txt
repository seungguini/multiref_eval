Yes it is!  Hopefully you can get that up to the A in no time!
Will that grade be good enough for you to pass?
Well, that's close enough to an A.
But it's not an A
It is close, but still only a B.
But it's still not an A. Maybe if I'd worked a little harder, I could've made an A.
What can I do to improve my grade?
I need an A to transfer
