Yes it is!  Hopefully you can get that up to the A in no time!
Well, that's close enough to an A.
But it's not an A
It is close, but still only a B.
What happens if you get a b?
But it's still not an A. Maybe if I'd worked a little harder, I could've made an A.
What can I do to improve my grade?
So close but it's not an A
