Okay, what's your account number?
Is that where you would like it deposited?
Do you have your debit card with you?
Okay then let's get you started.
Is there enough money in your account to cover the check if it bounces?
Would you like to use that account or open a new one?
Have you filled out any of the paperwork yet or do you need the forms?
May I see your ID card so that I can pull up your account?
