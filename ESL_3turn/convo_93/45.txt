Do you have a savings account as well?
Okay, what's your account number?
Is that where you would like to deposit it?
If you'll endorse your check and fill out a deposit slip, I can get that done for you.
Is that where you would like it deposited?
Is there enough money in your account to cover the check if it bounces?
Have you filled out any of the paperwork yet or do you need the forms?
May I see your ID card so that I can pull up your account?
