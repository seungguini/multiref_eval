Do you have a savings account as well?
Okay, what's your account number?
Is that where you would like to deposit it?
Do you have your debit card with you?
Okay then let's get you started.
Is there enough money in your account to cover the check if it bounces?
Would you like to use that account or open a new one?
May I see your ID card so that I can pull up your account?
