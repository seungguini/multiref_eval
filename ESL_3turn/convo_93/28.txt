Do you have a savings account as well?
Okay, what's your account number?
Is that where you would like to deposit it?
If you'll endorse your check and fill out a deposit slip, I can get that done for you.
Do you have your debit card with you?
Okay then let's get you started.
Would you like to use that account or open a new one?
Have you filled out any of the paperwork yet or do you need the forms?
