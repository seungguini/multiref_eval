Do you have a savings account as well?
Okay, what's your account number?
If you'll endorse your check and fill out a deposit slip, I can get that done for you.
Is that where you would like it deposited?
Do you have your debit card with you?
Is there enough money in your account to cover the check if it bounces?
Would you like to use that account or open a new one?
May I see your ID card so that I can pull up your account?
