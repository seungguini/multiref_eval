I mean, we argue sometimes.
We fight a lot. It's really stressful.
Sometimes but it doesn't happen often.
We pretty much stay out of each other's way.
Not really. We just make sure we respect each other's boundaries.
We mostly fight over chores and boundaries.
Only once in a while.
Nah, we're all good friends.
