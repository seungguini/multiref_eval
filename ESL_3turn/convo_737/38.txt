Sometimes, but mostly we get along.
We fight a lot. It's really stressful.
Sometimes but it doesn't happen often.
Only when people neglect the dishes!
Not really. We just make sure we respect each other's boundaries.
We mostly fight over chores and boundaries.
Only once in a while.
Nah, we're all good friends.
