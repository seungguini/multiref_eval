I mean, we argue sometimes.
Sometimes, but mostly we get along.
We pretty much stay out of each other's way.
Only when people neglect the dishes!
We mostly fight over chores and boundaries.
We used to. Then we decided to hire a house cleaning service, and we've been a happy family ever since.
Only once in a while.
Nah, we're all good friends.
