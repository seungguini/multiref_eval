I mean, we argue sometimes.
Sometimes, but mostly we get along.
Sometimes but it doesn't happen often.
We pretty much stay out of each other's way.
Only when people neglect the dishes!
Not really. We just make sure we respect each other's boundaries.
We mostly fight over chores and boundaries.
Nah, we're all good friends.
