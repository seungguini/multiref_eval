I mean, we argue sometimes.
Sometimes, but mostly we get along.
Sometimes but it doesn't happen often.
Only when people neglect the dishes!
Not really. We just make sure we respect each other's boundaries.
We mostly fight over chores and boundaries.
We used to. Then we decided to hire a house cleaning service, and we've been a happy family ever since.
Nah, we're all good friends.
