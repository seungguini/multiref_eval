I mean, we argue sometimes.
Sometimes, but mostly we get along.
We fight a lot. It's really stressful.
Sometimes but it doesn't happen often.
We mostly fight over chores and boundaries.
We used to. Then we decided to hire a house cleaning service, and we've been a happy family ever since.
Only once in a while.
Nah, we're all good friends.
