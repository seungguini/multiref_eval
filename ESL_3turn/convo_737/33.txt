I mean, we argue sometimes.
Sometimes, but mostly we get along.
We fight a lot. It's really stressful.
We pretty much stay out of each other's way.
Not really. We just make sure we respect each other's boundaries.
We mostly fight over chores and boundaries.
We used to. Then we decided to hire a house cleaning service, and we've been a happy family ever since.
Only once in a while.
