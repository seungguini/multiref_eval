I mean, we argue sometimes.
We fight a lot. It's really stressful.
Sometimes but it doesn't happen often.
We pretty much stay out of each other's way.
Only when people neglect the dishes!
Not really. We just make sure we respect each other's boundaries.
We used to. Then we decided to hire a house cleaning service, and we've been a happy family ever since.
Nah, we're all good friends.
