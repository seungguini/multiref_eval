What about looking in the internet.
It's not a waste if you get a good grade.
I'll drive for you, then.
There are many online book sources.
Can't you do it online?
Then waste your time finding books that aren't there.
Do you have to use books, or can you use an online source?
Don't give up. You don't want to fail.
