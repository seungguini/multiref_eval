What about looking in the internet.
It's not a waste if you get a good grade.
I'll drive for you, then.
Did you see if they can order it from another library?
Can't you do it online?
Then waste your time finding books that aren't there.
Do you have to use books, or can you use an online source?
Don't give up. You don't want to fail.
