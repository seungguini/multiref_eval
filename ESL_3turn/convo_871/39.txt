I feel that they're more boring.
That's very much true.
I find it hard to follow in black and white.
I do like color movies though.
I think having monotone colors can take me out from the plot of an old movie.
They don't pique my interest like in-color movies.
Yes what difference does it make if they are in color?
I agree, I think the lack of color adds to the story.
