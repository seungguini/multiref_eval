I feel that they're more boring.
That's very much true.
I do like color movies though.
They don't pique my interest like in-color movies.
I get tired of the old ones sometimes.
I disagree, I think visuals are equally important.
I agree, I think the lack of color adds to the story.
What are your favorite ones?
