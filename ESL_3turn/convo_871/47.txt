I feel that they're more boring.
I agree with you.
I think having monotone colors can take me out from the plot of an old movie.
They don't pique my interest like in-color movies.
I get tired of the old ones sometimes.
I disagree, I think visuals are equally important.
Yes what difference does it make if they are in color?
What are your favorite ones?
