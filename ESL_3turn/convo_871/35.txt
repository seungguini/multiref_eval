Absolutely I cannot argue with that.
I feel that they're more boring.
The color would be nice though.
I do like color movies though.
I think having monotone colors can take me out from the plot of an old movie.
I get tired of the old ones sometimes.
Yes what difference does it make if they are in color?
I agree, I think the lack of color adds to the story.
