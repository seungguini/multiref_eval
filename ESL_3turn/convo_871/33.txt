Absolutely I cannot argue with that.
I agree with you.
The color would be nice though.
I do like color movies though.
I think having monotone colors can take me out from the plot of an old movie.
They don't pique my interest like in-color movies.
I agree, I think the lack of color adds to the story.
What are your favorite ones?
