Absolutely I cannot argue with that.
I agree with you.
That's very much true.
The color would be nice though.
I do like color movies though.
I think having monotone colors can take me out from the plot of an old movie.
I disagree, I think visuals are equally important.
Yes what difference does it make if they are in color?
