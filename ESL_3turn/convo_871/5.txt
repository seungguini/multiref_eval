I agree with you.
That's very much true.
The color would be nice though.
I find it hard to follow in black and white.
I think having monotone colors can take me out from the plot of an old movie.
They don't pique my interest like in-color movies.
Yes what difference does it make if they are in color?
What are your favorite ones?
