Absolutely I cannot argue with that.
I feel that they're more boring.
I agree with you.
That's very much true.
I do like color movies though.
I think having monotone colors can take me out from the plot of an old movie.
I get tired of the old ones sometimes.
I agree, I think the lack of color adds to the story.
