Absolutely I cannot argue with that.
I feel that they're more boring.
The color would be nice though.
I find it hard to follow in black and white.
I get tired of the old ones sometimes.
I disagree, I think visuals are equally important.
Yes what difference does it make if they are in color?
What are your favorite ones?
