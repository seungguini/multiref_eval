I feel that they're more boring.
I agree with you.
That's very much true.
I find it hard to follow in black and white.
I think having monotone colors can take me out from the plot of an old movie.
They don't pique my interest like in-color movies.
I agree, I think the lack of color adds to the story.
What are your favorite ones?
