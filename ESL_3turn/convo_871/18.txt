Absolutely I cannot argue with that.
I feel that they're more boring.
The color would be nice though.
I find it hard to follow in black and white.
I do like color movies though.
They don't pique my interest like in-color movies.
I disagree, I think visuals are equally important.
I agree, I think the lack of color adds to the story.
