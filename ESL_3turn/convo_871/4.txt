I feel that they're more boring.
That's very much true.
The color would be nice though.
I do like color movies though.
They don't pique my interest like in-color movies.
I get tired of the old ones sometimes.
I disagree, I think visuals are equally important.
Yes what difference does it make if they are in color?
