Absolutely I cannot argue with that.
I feel that they're more boring.
I agree with you.
The color would be nice though.
I find it hard to follow in black and white.
I do like color movies though.
I think having monotone colors can take me out from the plot of an old movie.
Yes what difference does it make if they are in color?
