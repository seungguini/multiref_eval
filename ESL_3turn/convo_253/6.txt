That's interesting.
Well, the doctor's office is pretty busy and crowded right now.
This due to a new change in policy, it is safer for everyone involved.

I never heard of that before.
No need to worry, its right next to the doctor's office. Nothing else has changed.
This is just as good.
Now your insurance says you have to do it here.
