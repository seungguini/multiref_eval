That's interesting.
This due to a new change in policy, it is safer for everyone involved.
You don't say?
I never heard of that before.
No need to worry, its right next to the doctor's office. Nothing else has changed.
This is just as good.
I think you'll find this a lot more convenient.
Now your insurance says you have to do it here.
