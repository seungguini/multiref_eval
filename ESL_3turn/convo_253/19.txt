That's interesting.
Well, the doctor's office is pretty busy and crowded right now.
This due to a new change in policy, it is safer for everyone involved.
We take many samples every day.
I never heard of that before.
No need to worry, its right next to the doctor's office. Nothing else has changed.
This is just as good.
I think you'll find this a lot more convenient.
