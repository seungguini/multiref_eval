Yes the next street is Gage Avenue.
That's okay, it's just one block away.
That's really unlucky, there are no more buses.
I don't know where Gage is.
I'm just kidding, it's Gage Avenue.
You should have ask the bus driver.
Don't worry, Gage Avenue is actually really close by.
I do that all the time.
