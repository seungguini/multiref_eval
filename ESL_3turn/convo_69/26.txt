Just wait for the next bus to come.
You can catch the next bus.
That's really unlucky, there are no more buses.
Just walk a few blocks and you'll be there.
I'm just kidding, it's Gage Avenue.
You should have ask the bus driver.
Don't worry, Gage Avenue is actually really close by.
I do that all the time.
