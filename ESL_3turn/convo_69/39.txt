Just wait for the next bus to come.
That's really unlucky, there are no more buses.
That's OK, it's just one block over.
Gage is just one block over.
Just walk a few blocks and you'll be there.
You should have ask the bus driver.
Don't worry, Gage Avenue is actually really close by.
I do that all the time.
