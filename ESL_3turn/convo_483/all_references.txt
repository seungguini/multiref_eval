What is the price of the house?
I think we can afford that.
What would the monthly payment be?
Maybe we should see about a loan.
Are the sellers willing to negotiate?
That's not really within our budget.
We can't afford that; we'll have to look elsewhere.
I think we can manage that.
We are looking a a number of houses.
Can we talk them down?
Has there been a lot of interest in this house?
Is that typical or out of the ordinary?
I really do love this place.
