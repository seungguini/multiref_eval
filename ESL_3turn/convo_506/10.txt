Okay, here you go.
My passport? You never told me that.
Oh no I forgot it at home.
I'm 18 now, remember? I can hand them over myself to the customs people.
I don't have it with me.
I'll need to dig it out of my carry-on.
That's rather unfortunate, I left it at home.
What do you need my passport for?
