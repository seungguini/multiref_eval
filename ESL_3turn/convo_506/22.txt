I left that at home.
Okay, here you go.
I don't have one but I do have a visa.
I'd rather hold on to my own paperwork.
My passport? You never told me that.
I'm 18 now, remember? I can hand them over myself to the customs people.
I'll need to dig it out of my carry-on.
What do you need my passport for?
