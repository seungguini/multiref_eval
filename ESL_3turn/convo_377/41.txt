That's proof enough for me.
Did you commit another crime?
Yeah but you pulled a gun on someone!
I don't know if that will stand up in court.
How can you prove that?
I think you need to get a lawyer then.
You got arrested because you were drinking while driving.
That sounds like a terrible experience.
