Did you commit another crime?
I don't know if that will stand up in court.
Why did this confusion happen, then?
Well the judge doesn't agree with you!
How can you prove that?
Who was the officer that arrested you?
You got arrested because you were drinking while driving.
That sounds like a terrible experience.
