I hate baseball.
It was rained out.
I don't want to watch that.
That's an idea.
You know I don't watch sports.
You really want to watch another baseball game?
It got rained out.
I hate baseball.
How about we go to the movies instead?
That's going to be so boring.
Not on right now.
Why don't we get out of the house and go for a walk?
I forgot that was on.
I don't think it's started yet.
