That sounds like fun.
That's very kind, I appreciate the consideration.
At least that's something.
I really don't like going to the theater.
What if I don't want to see some local theater production, is there anything else I can do?
How bad can the weather be?
I think I just might want to take a nap
I was really looking forward to the tour, will it be rescheduled?
