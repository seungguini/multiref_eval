Thank you.
That sounds like fun.
That's very kind, I appreciate the consideration.
That sounds great! I never thought of that.
What if I don't want to see some local theater production, is there anything else I can do?
Is there a museum nearby? I'd rather do that.
How bad can the weather be?
I think I just might want to take a nap
