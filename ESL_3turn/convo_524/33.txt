Thank you.
That sounds like fun.
That's very kind, I appreciate the consideration.
I really don't like going to the theater.
Is there a museum nearby? I'd rather do that.
How bad can the weather be?
Maybe the hotel can find something better than the theater for me.
I was really looking forward to the tour, will it be rescheduled?
