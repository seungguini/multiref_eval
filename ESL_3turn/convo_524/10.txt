That sounds like fun.
That's very kind, I appreciate the consideration.
That sounds great! I never thought of that.
At least that's something.
I really don't like going to the theater.
How bad can the weather be?
I think I just might want to take a nap
Maybe the hotel can find something better than the theater for me.
