Thank you.
That sounds great! I never thought of that.
At least that's something.
What if I don't want to see some local theater production, is there anything else I can do?
How bad can the weather be?
I think I just might want to take a nap
Maybe the hotel can find something better than the theater for me.
If the tour is cancelled I think I'll make my own plans.
