Thank you.
That's very kind, I appreciate the consideration.
That sounds great! I never thought of that.
I really don't like going to the theater.
How bad can the weather be?
I think I just might want to take a nap
I was really looking forward to the tour, will it be rescheduled?
If the tour is cancelled I think I'll make my own plans.
