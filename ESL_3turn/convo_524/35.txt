That sounds like fun.
That's very kind, I appreciate the consideration.
That sounds great! I never thought of that.
I really don't like going to the theater.
Is there a museum nearby? I'd rather do that.
I see, is that the only scheduled event for this evening?
I think I just might want to take a nap
That's a bummer, I was looking forward to this.
