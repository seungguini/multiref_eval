Thank you.
That sounds like fun.
That sounds great! I never thought of that.
I really don't like going to the theater.
What if I don't want to see some local theater production, is there anything else I can do?
Is there a museum nearby? I'd rather do that.
I think I just might want to take a nap
That's a bummer, I was looking forward to this.
