That sounds like fun.
That's very kind, I appreciate the consideration.
I really don't like going to the theater.
What if I don't want to see some local theater production, is there anything else I can do?
Is there a museum nearby? I'd rather do that.
I think I just might want to take a nap
Maybe the hotel can find something better than the theater for me.
If the tour is cancelled I think I'll make my own plans.
