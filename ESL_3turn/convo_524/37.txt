That sounds like fun.
That sounds great! I never thought of that.
What if I don't want to see some local theater production, is there anything else I can do?
How bad can the weather be?
I see, is that the only scheduled event for this evening?
I was really looking forward to the tour, will it be rescheduled?
That's a bummer, I was looking forward to this.
If the tour is cancelled I think I'll make my own plans.
