Thank you.
That sounds like fun.
I really don't like going to the theater.
I see, is that the only scheduled event for this evening?
I think I just might want to take a nap
Maybe the hotel can find something better than the theater for me.
I was really looking forward to the tour, will it be rescheduled?
That's a bummer, I was looking forward to this.
