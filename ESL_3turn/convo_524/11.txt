Thank you.
That's very kind, I appreciate the consideration.
That sounds great! I never thought of that.
At least that's something.
What if I don't want to see some local theater production, is there anything else I can do?
I think I just might want to take a nap
I was really looking forward to the tour, will it be rescheduled?
That's a bummer, I was looking forward to this.
