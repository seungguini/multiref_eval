Thank you.
That sounds like fun.
I really don't like going to the theater.
What if I don't want to see some local theater production, is there anything else I can do?
How bad can the weather be?
I see, is that the only scheduled event for this evening?
I was really looking forward to the tour, will it be rescheduled?
If the tour is cancelled I think I'll make my own plans.
