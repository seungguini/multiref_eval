That sounds like fun.
That sounds great! I never thought of that.
I really don't like going to the theater.
What if I don't want to see some local theater production, is there anything else I can do?
Maybe the hotel can find something better than the theater for me.
I was really looking forward to the tour, will it be rescheduled?
That's a bummer, I was looking forward to this.
If the tour is cancelled I think I'll make my own plans.
