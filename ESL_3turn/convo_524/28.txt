That sounds like fun.
That sounds great! I never thought of that.
At least that's something.
What if I don't want to see some local theater production, is there anything else I can do?
Is there a museum nearby? I'd rather do that.
How bad can the weather be?
I see, is that the only scheduled event for this evening?
If the tour is cancelled I think I'll make my own plans.
