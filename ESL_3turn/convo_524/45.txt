That sounds like fun.
At least that's something.
What if I don't want to see some local theater production, is there anything else I can do?
How bad can the weather be?
Maybe the hotel can find something better than the theater for me.
I was really looking forward to the tour, will it be rescheduled?
That's a bummer, I was looking forward to this.
If the tour is cancelled I think I'll make my own plans.
