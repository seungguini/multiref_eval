Thank you.
That's very kind, I appreciate the consideration.
Is there a museum nearby? I'd rather do that.
How bad can the weather be?
Maybe the hotel can find something better than the theater for me.
I was really looking forward to the tour, will it be rescheduled?
That's a bummer, I was looking forward to this.
If the tour is cancelled I think I'll make my own plans.
