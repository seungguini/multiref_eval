Thank you.
That sounds great! I never thought of that.
At least that's something.
I really don't like going to the theater.
I think I just might want to take a nap
Maybe the hotel can find something better than the theater for me.
That's a bummer, I was looking forward to this.
If the tour is cancelled I think I'll make my own plans.
