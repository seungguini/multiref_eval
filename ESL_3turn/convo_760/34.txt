Aw, okay. I hope you feel better.
I hope you get feeling better
Do you need a ride?
Are you sure? It's hot out.
I think there's a thermometer in the first aid cabinet if you need it
Do you want me to drive you home?
So you want me to bring you some soup?
Now that you mention it, you don't look so good.
