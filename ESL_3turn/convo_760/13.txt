I hope you get feeling better
How long have you not been feeling well?
Do you need a ride?
Looks like you never got over your cold.
I think there's a thermometer in the first aid cabinet if you need it
Do you want me to drive you home?
Now that you mention it, you don't look so good.
Do you need a ride?
