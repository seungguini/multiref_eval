Aw, okay. I hope you feel better.
How long have you not been feeling well?
Looks like you never got over your cold.
I think there's a thermometer in the first aid cabinet if you need it
Do you want me to drive you home?
So you want me to bring you some soup?
Now that you mention it, you don't look so good.
Do you need a ride?
