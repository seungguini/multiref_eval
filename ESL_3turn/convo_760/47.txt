Aw, okay. I hope you feel better.
You should get that checked out.
How long have you not been feeling well?
I have some tylenol if you want!
Then going home is a good idea.
Looks like you never got over your cold.
I think there's a thermometer in the first aid cabinet if you need it
Now that you mention it, you don't look so good.
