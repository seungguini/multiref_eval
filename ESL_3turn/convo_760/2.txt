You should get that checked out.
Do you need a ride?
Then going home is a good idea.
Looks like you never got over your cold.
Are you sure? It's hot out.
I think there's a thermometer in the first aid cabinet if you need it
So you want me to bring you some soup?
Now that you mention it, you don't look so good.
