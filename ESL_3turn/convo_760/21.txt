I hope you get feeling better
How long have you not been feeling well?
I have some tylenol if you want!
Looks like you never got over your cold.
Are you sure? It's hot out.
I think there's a thermometer in the first aid cabinet if you need it
So you want me to bring you some soup?
Do you need a ride?
