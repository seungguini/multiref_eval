You should get that checked out.
How long have you not been feeling well?
I have some tylenol if you want!
Looks like you never got over your cold.
Are you sure? It's hot out.
I think there's a thermometer in the first aid cabinet if you need it
Now that you mention it, you don't look so good.
Do you need a ride?
