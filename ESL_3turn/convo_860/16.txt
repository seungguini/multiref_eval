Why don't you leave me alone
I work two jobs and at home I'd just like to relax.
You're such a kill joy. I'm having fun.
I am taking a break, and I like this show.
Tv isn't wasting my life.
Why do you care? I'm enjoying myself.
I have learned so many new and interesting things from watching tv.
My life is watching TV
