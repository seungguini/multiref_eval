Why don't you leave me alone
I work two jobs and at home I'd just like to relax.
I enjoy watching tv though.
You're such a kill joy. I'm having fun.
I am taking a break, and I like this show.
Tv isn't wasting my life.
What exactly would you have me do right now instead?
You watch TV too, so hush up
