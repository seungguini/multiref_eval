Why don't you leave me alone
You're such a kill joy. I'm having fun.
I am taking a break, and I like this show.
How would you know?
Tv isn't wasting my life.
What exactly would you have me do right now instead?
I have learned so many new and interesting things from watching tv.
You watch TV too, so hush up
