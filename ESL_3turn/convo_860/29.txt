I work two jobs and at home I'd just like to relax.
I am taking a break, and I like this show.
How would you know?
What exactly would you have me do right now instead?
Maybe you're right.
I have learned so many new and interesting things from watching tv.
My life is watching TV
You watch TV too, so hush up
