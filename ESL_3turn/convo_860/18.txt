Why don't you leave me alone
I work two jobs and at home I'd just like to relax.
You're such a kill joy. I'm having fun.
How would you know?
Why do you care? I'm enjoying myself.
What exactly would you have me do right now instead?
I have learned so many new and interesting things from watching tv.
You watch TV too, so hush up
