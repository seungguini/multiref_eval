You can go to the information booth to find out which bus to take.
Which rental car location?
Go to the booth that has Rental Car Shuttles.
I can find you a shuttle bus to take you to your rental car.
OH, that one is here right now, you need to hurry.
You should be able to find it by following the signs.
That person over there can show you the way.
Sorry I dont know either.
