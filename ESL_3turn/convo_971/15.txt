Don't worry. I was being careful.
thanks for letting me know.
You're so paranoid.
No one could see anything. I didn't have any account information up at that moment.
There's no one around!
Oops! I should be more careful. Thanks for the reminder.
If they want it that bad, they will find it
You're right. I'll avoid checking my phone at the ATM in the future.
