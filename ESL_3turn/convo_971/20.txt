You're so paranoid.
No one could see anything. I didn't have any account information up at that moment.
next time i'll be more aware.
I needed to check on something
Thanks for the input
Oops! I should be more careful. Thanks for the reminder.
If they want it that bad, they will find it
You're right. I'll avoid checking my phone at the ATM in the future.
