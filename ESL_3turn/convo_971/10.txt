thanks for letting me know.
You're so paranoid.
I'll be more careful
No one could see anything. I didn't have any account information up at that moment.
next time i'll be more aware.
I needed to check on something
If they want it that bad, they will find it
You're right. I'll avoid checking my phone at the ATM in the future.
