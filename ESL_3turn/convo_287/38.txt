I am going to visit my mom and dad.
I'm going camping also!
I'm going up to Yosemite with my girlfriend.
I am going to a spa. I can't wait.
We are taking the kids to Nashville.
I'm going on the same trip with you, stupid.
I am taking my husband to the beach for the summer.
I'll be in San Francisco.
