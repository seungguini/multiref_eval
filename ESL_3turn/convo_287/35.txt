I am going to my moms.
I'm going up to Yosemite with my girlfriend.
I'm going to visit my mother in the hospital.
I'm going on the same trip with you, stupid.
We have a wedding out of town to attend.
I don't know yet.
I'll be in San Francisco.
I am meeting a friend for a concert halfway between us.
