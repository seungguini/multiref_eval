There's a bus stop every few blocks.
I have a bus map I can lend to you.
I'm not sure.
The transit station is on the next corner and you can get just about anywhere from there.
They are everywhere.
Where are you trying to travel to? They all go to different destinations.
Where do you want to go?
The station is right there.
