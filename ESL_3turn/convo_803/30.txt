Where are you heading?
I have a bus map I can lend to you.
I'm not sure.
The transit station is on the next corner and you can get just about anywhere from there.
Where are you trying to travel to? They all go to different destinations.
There is a bus stop near the grocery store.
Where do you want to go?
The station is right there.
