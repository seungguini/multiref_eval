Why can't I park here there is not sign?
Thank you for telling me, I'll find a new space.
No problem I will move it.
Why can't I park here?
There should really be a sign here.
Why can't I park here?
Where am I supposed to park?
The sign says that this area is available for parking.
I'm sorry, allow me to move.
This is where the guy told me to go.
Who are you?
But this is my spot.
Where do you recommend I go?
I own this parking lot.
