Why can't I park here there is not sign?
Thank you for telling me, I'll find a new space.
No problem I will move it.
There should really be a sign here.
Where am I supposed to park?
The sign says that this area is available for parking.
This is where the guy told me to go.
Where do you recommend I go?
