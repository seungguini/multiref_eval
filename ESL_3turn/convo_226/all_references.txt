You can sleep when you're dead.
That hasn't ever mattered to you before!
Why not just stay a little longer?
You can manage on three hours of sleep.
Sleep is important.
Oh for sure, go get some sleep then!
I'll see you tomorrow then.
Dude, that's a bummer.
You need to take care of yourself.
Well, that's your problem then.
Skip class and have fun!
Should I call you a cab.
So do I, but I'm staying up.
I guess we should head home then.
