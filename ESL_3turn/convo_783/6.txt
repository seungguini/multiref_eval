I don't have any money to spend there
You're going to buy another sweater that you're never going to wear?
Okay I'll go with you.
You are such a clothes horse.
Are you buying that as a gift for me?
You just love to spend money.
What kind of sweater are you going to get?
I think I know which one you're talking about.
