I don't have any money to spend there
Why do you need another sweater?  You have a whole closet full.
You're going to buy another sweater that you're never going to wear?
Okay I'll go with you.
What's wrong with your old sweater?
You just love to spend money.
What kind of sweater are you going to get?
Is it gonna be an ugly sweater?
