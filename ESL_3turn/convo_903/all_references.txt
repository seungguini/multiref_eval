Now I feel bad for you.
What are we going to do?
Maybe it's for the best, we will have lots of time to study.
Sorry.
Well I guess I shouldn't complain then.
We should have gotten up earlier.
What a waste of a semester this is going to be.
I guess you'll have lots of time to work.
That is not enough.
What will we do?
Which one?
