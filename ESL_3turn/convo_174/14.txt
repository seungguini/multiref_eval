Well you need to tell me something specific.
Well, what kind of style?
Formal or casual?
Be grateful you don't need new clothes because you already have enough in your closet.
Something more feminine or masculine?
I'd certainly hope so. What's your budget?
I will give you a make over.
Have you thought about checking thrift stores?
