Well you need to tell me something specific.
Be grateful you don't need new clothes because you already have enough in your closet.
You should go shopping with me.
I'd certainly hope so. What's your budget?
What's wrong with your current style?
when's the last time you bought new clothes?
I will give you a make over.
Have you thought about checking thrift stores?
