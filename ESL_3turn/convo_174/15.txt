Really, like what? Everyone's wearing crop tops these days.
Well you need to tell me something specific.
Have you checked out that new store that opened up?
Formal or casual?
Be grateful you don't need new clothes because you already have enough in your closet.
I'd certainly hope so. What's your budget?
when's the last time you bought new clothes?
I will give you a make over.
