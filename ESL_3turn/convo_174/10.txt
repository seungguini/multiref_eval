Well you need to tell me something specific.
Have you checked out that new store that opened up?
Be grateful you don't need new clothes because you already have enough in your closet.
You should go shopping with me.
I'd certainly hope so. What's your budget?
I can help you with that.
I will give you a make over.
Have you thought about checking thrift stores?
