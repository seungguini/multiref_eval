Really, like what? Everyone's wearing crop tops these days.
Well you need to tell me something specific.
Formal or casual?
You should go shopping with me.
I'd certainly hope so. What's your budget?
What's wrong with your current style?
when's the last time you bought new clothes?
Have you thought about checking thrift stores?
