Really, like what? Everyone's wearing crop tops these days.
Well you need to tell me something specific.
Have you checked out that new store that opened up?
Be grateful you don't need new clothes because you already have enough in your closet.
You should go shopping with me.
when's the last time you bought new clothes?
I will give you a make over.
Have you thought about checking thrift stores?
