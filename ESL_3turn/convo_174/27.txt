Really, like what? Everyone's wearing crop tops these days.
Well you need to tell me something specific.
Well, what kind of style?
Be grateful you don't need new clothes because you already have enough in your closet.
You should go shopping with me.
I can help you with that.
Have you thought about checking thrift stores?
I can be your stylist.
