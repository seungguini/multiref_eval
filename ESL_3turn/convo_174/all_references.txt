Really, like what? Everyone's wearing crop tops these days.
Well you need to tell me something specific.
Well, what kind of style?
Have you checked out that new store that opened up?
Formal or casual?
Be grateful you don't need new clothes because you already have enough in your closet.
Something more feminine or masculine?
You should go shopping with me.
I'd certainly hope so. What's your budget?
What's wrong with your current style?
I can help you with that.
when's the last time you bought new clothes?
I will give you a make over.
Have you thought about checking thrift stores?
I can be your stylist.
