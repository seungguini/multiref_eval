Well you need to tell me something specific.
Formal or casual?
Be grateful you don't need new clothes because you already have enough in your closet.
Something more feminine or masculine?
You should go shopping with me.
I can help you with that.
I will give you a make over.
Have you thought about checking thrift stores?
