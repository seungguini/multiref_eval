Have you checked out that new store that opened up?
Formal or casual?
Be grateful you don't need new clothes because you already have enough in your closet.
Something more feminine or masculine?
I'd certainly hope so. What's your budget?
What's wrong with your current style?
when's the last time you bought new clothes?
Have you thought about checking thrift stores?
