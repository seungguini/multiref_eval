Well you need to tell me something specific.
Well, what kind of style?
Formal or casual?
Be grateful you don't need new clothes because you already have enough in your closet.
I'd certainly hope so. What's your budget?
when's the last time you bought new clothes?
I will give you a make over.
Have you thought about checking thrift stores?
