Well you need to tell me something specific.
Well, what kind of style?
Have you checked out that new store that opened up?
Be grateful you don't need new clothes because you already have enough in your closet.
You should go shopping with me.
What's wrong with your current style?
I will give you a make over.
Have you thought about checking thrift stores?
