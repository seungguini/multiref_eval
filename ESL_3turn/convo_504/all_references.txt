Do you want to do it?
Sure it is.
Would you be quiet and let me work?
I read it on the internet.
Well, I'm just following the directions.
Why not?
This is what it said to do in the instructions.
Can you help me.
But that's what the picture says.
I've been starting to get that feeling.
I'm sure the landlord won't mind.
Uh oh, I hope I didn't mess this up.
Trust me, I know what I'm doing.
Really? Then how am I supposed to get the darn thing in the wall?
