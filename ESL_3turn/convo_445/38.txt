Yeah but how else should I get rid of them?
That's true.
Yes, true, but aphids are bad, and this pesticide is all natural.
You're right. I won't do it again.
I want to prevent some insects from ruining my crop.
They aren't? Name one insect, besides honey bees that are "good".
Many insects are bad.
I am spraying to protect my garden.
