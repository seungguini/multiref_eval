Yeah but how else should I get rid of them?
That's true.
Yes, true, but aphids are bad, and this pesticide is all natural.
This doesn't kill all insects, just certain kinds.
They aren't? Name one insect, besides honey bees that are "good".
Many insects are bad.
I hate insects.
I am spraying to protect my garden.
