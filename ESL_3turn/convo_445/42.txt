Yeah but how else should I get rid of them?
That's true.
Yes, true, but aphids are bad, and this pesticide is all natural.
This doesn't kill all insects, just certain kinds.
You're right. I won't do it again.
I still don't want them on my food!
Many insects are bad.
I am spraying to protect my garden.
