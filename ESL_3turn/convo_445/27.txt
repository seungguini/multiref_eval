That's true.
Yes, true, but aphids are bad, and this pesticide is all natural.
This doesn't kill all insects, just certain kinds.
They aren't? Name one insect, besides honey bees that are "good".
I still don't want them on my food!
Many insects are bad.
I hate insects.
I am spraying to protect my garden.
