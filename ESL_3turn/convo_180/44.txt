Ah, I can smell very well.
Do you go around smelling other people's noses?
OH, I see what you mean now.
How do you know that my nose is good-smelling?
You mean they have a good sense of smell?
Well, you should have been more clear.
Okay, then. How is your sense of smell?
Are you able to smell from a long distance?
