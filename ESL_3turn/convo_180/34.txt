OH, well I can't smell anything.
Ah, I can smell very well.
Don't all noses smell?
Do you go around smelling other people's noses?
Ah, my sense of smell is about as good as the way my nose looks.
How do you know that my nose is good-smelling?
Okay, then. How is your sense of smell?
Are you able to smell from a long distance?
