OH, well I can't smell anything.
Don't all noses smell?
Do you go around smelling other people's noses?
OH, I see what you mean now.
Ah, my sense of smell is about as good as the way my nose looks.
How do you know that my nose is good-smelling?
Okay, then. How is your sense of smell?
Are you able to smell from a long distance?
