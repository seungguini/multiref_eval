OH, well I can't smell anything.
Don't all noses smell?
Do you go around smelling other people's noses?
OH, I see what you mean now.
Ah, my sense of smell is about as good as the way my nose looks.
You mean they have a good sense of smell?
Well, you should have been more clear.
Okay, then. How is your sense of smell?
