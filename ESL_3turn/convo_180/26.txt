OH, well I can't smell anything.
Ah, I can smell very well.
Don't all noses smell?
Do you go around smelling other people's noses?
OH, I see what you mean now.
Ah, my sense of smell is about as good as the way my nose looks.
Okay, then. How is your sense of smell?
Are you able to smell from a long distance?
