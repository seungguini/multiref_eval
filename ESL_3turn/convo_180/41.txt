OH, well I can't smell anything.
Ah, I can smell very well.
Don't all noses smell?
Ah, my sense of smell is about as good as the way my nose looks.
You mean they have a good sense of smell?
Well, you should have been more clear.
Okay, then. How is your sense of smell?
Are you able to smell from a long distance?
