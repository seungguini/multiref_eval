OH, well I can't smell anything.
Ah, I can smell very well.
Don't all noses smell?
Do you go around smelling other people's noses?
Ah, my sense of smell is about as good as the way my nose looks.
You mean they have a good sense of smell?
Well, you should have been more clear.
Are you able to smell from a long distance?
