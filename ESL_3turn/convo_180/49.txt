OH, well I can't smell anything.
Ah, I can smell very well.
Don't all noses smell?
Do you go around smelling other people's noses?
Ah, my sense of smell is about as good as the way my nose looks.
How do you know that my nose is good-smelling?
You mean they have a good sense of smell?
Okay, then. How is your sense of smell?
