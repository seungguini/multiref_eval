I'm sorry, we don't have any storage services.
I think you can hold on to your luggage for a little longer.
Sorry but once a patron checks out we can not be responsible for their belongings.
We don't make it a policy to store luggage prior to a departing flight.
Sure, we can store it for you.
Well then, I suppose we can hold it for quite some time.
We normally don't watch luggage but I can make an exception for you just this one time as a courtesey.
You can check your bags in early at the baggage claim office.
