Would you like to go shopping to pick out some new clothes?
How do they dress?
Who cares?  They are a bunch of snobs.
I wish they would try to get to know your personality, you're such an awesome person!
Who wants to dress like them?
Don't worry. You'll make friends who love you no matter what you wear.
You'll find your group.
You'll find people who don't judge you based on what you wear.
