And how is it that they dress?
Would you like to go shopping to pick out some new clothes?
I wish they would try to get to know your personality, you're such an awesome person!
What is wrong with the way you dress?
Who wants to dress like them?
If they're going to judge you on your clothing they probably are not very nice people.
Don't worry. You'll make friends who love you no matter what you wear.
You'll find your group.
