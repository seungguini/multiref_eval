And how is it that they dress?
Would you like to go shopping to pick out some new clothes?
Who cares?  They are a bunch of snobs.
It's because their parents don't care what they wear.
What is wrong with the way you dress?
Who wants to dress like them?
If they're going to judge you on your clothing they probably are not very nice people.
You'll find people who don't judge you based on what you wear.
