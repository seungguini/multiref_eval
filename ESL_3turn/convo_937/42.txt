And how is it that they dress?
How do they dress?
Who cares?  They are a bunch of snobs.
I wish they would try to get to know your personality, you're such an awesome person!
Who wants to dress like them?
Don't worry. You'll make friends who love you no matter what you wear.
Find new friends.
You'll find your group.
