And how is it that they dress?
How do they dress?
Who cares?  They are a bunch of snobs.
I wish they would try to get to know your personality, you're such an awesome person!
What is wrong with the way you dress?
Don't worry. You'll make friends who love you no matter what you wear.
You'll find your group.
You'll find people who don't judge you based on what you wear.
