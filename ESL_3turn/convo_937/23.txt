Would you like to go shopping to pick out some new clothes?
Who cares?  They are a bunch of snobs.
I wish they would try to get to know your personality, you're such an awesome person!
What is wrong with the way you dress?
Who wants to dress like them?
Find new friends.
You'll find your group.
You'll find people who don't judge you based on what you wear.
