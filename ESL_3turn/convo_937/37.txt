And how is it that they dress?
Would you like to go shopping to pick out some new clothes?
Who cares?  They are a bunch of snobs.
It's because their parents don't care what they wear.
I wish they would try to get to know your personality, you're such an awesome person!
Who wants to dress like them?
Don't worry. You'll make friends who love you no matter what you wear.
Find new friends.
