And how is it that they dress?
Would you like to go shopping to pick out some new clothes?
Who cares?  They are a bunch of snobs.
Who wants to dress like them?
Don't worry. You'll make friends who love you no matter what you wear.
Find new friends.
You'll find your group.
You'll find people who don't judge you based on what you wear.
