Would you like to go shopping to pick out some new clothes?
How do they dress?
It's because their parents don't care what they wear.
I wish they would try to get to know your personality, you're such an awesome person!
Who wants to dress like them?
If they're going to judge you on your clothing they probably are not very nice people.
Don't worry. You'll make friends who love you no matter what you wear.
Find new friends.
