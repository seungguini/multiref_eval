And how is it that they dress?
How do they dress?
It's because their parents don't care what they wear.
I wish they would try to get to know your personality, you're such an awesome person!
What is wrong with the way you dress?
If they're going to judge you on your clothing they probably are not very nice people.
Find new friends.
You'll find people who don't judge you based on what you wear.
