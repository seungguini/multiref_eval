Would you like to go shopping to pick out some new clothes?
How do they dress?
It's because their parents don't care what they wear.
I wish they would try to get to know your personality, you're such an awesome person!
If they're going to judge you on your clothing they probably are not very nice people.
Find new friends.
You'll find your group.
You'll find people who don't judge you based on what you wear.
