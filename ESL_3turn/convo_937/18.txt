And how is it that they dress?
How do they dress?
It's because their parents don't care what they wear.
I wish they would try to get to know your personality, you're such an awesome person!
Who wants to dress like them?
Don't worry. You'll make friends who love you no matter what you wear.
You'll find your group.
You'll find people who don't judge you based on what you wear.
