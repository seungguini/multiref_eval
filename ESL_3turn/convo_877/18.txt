I like basketball the most.
I like them all.
I enjoy playing basketball at the park.
This year I will have to say basketball.
My favorite is football.
I'm into soccer, or what most people around the world call, futbol.
I play ice hokey currently, and I've been really enjoying it.
I am a big tennis fan.
