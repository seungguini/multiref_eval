I like basketball the most.
I enjoy soccer, I played it as a child.
This year I will have to say basketball.
My favorite is football.
I'm into soccer, or what most people around the world call, futbol.
My family watches a lot of basketball and it grew on me.
I like gathering with my friends and spending time with them watching baseball.
I really love auto racing.
