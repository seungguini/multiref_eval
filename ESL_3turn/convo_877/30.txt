I enjoy soccer, I played it as a child.
I like them all.
I enjoy playing basketball at the park.
My favorite is football.
I play ice hokey currently, and I've been really enjoying it.
I am a big tennis fan.
My family watches a lot of basketball and it grew on me.
I like gathering with my friends and spending time with them watching baseball.
