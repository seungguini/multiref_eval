I like basketball the most.
I enjoy soccer, I played it as a child.
I like them all.
This year I will have to say basketball.
I love watching football and rooting for my favorite team.
I play ice hokey currently, and I've been really enjoying it.
My family watches a lot of basketball and it grew on me.
I like gathering with my friends and spending time with them watching baseball.
