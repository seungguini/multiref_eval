I enjoy soccer, I played it as a child.
This year I will have to say basketball.
I love watching football and rooting for my favorite team.
My favorite is football.
I'm into soccer, or what most people around the world call, futbol.
I play ice hokey currently, and I've been really enjoying it.
My family watches a lot of basketball and it grew on me.
Soccer of course.
