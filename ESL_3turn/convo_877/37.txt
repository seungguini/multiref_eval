I like basketball the most.
I like them all.
I enjoy playing basketball at the park.
I play ice hokey currently, and I've been really enjoying it.
My family watches a lot of basketball and it grew on me.
Soccer of course.
I like gathering with my friends and spending time with them watching baseball.
I really love auto racing.
