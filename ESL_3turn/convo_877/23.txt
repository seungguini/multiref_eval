I like basketball the most.
This year I will have to say basketball.
I'm into soccer, or what most people around the world call, futbol.
I play ice hokey currently, and I've been really enjoying it.
I am a big tennis fan.
Soccer of course.
I like gathering with my friends and spending time with them watching baseball.
I really love auto racing.
