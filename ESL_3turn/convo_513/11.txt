No, we do not allow them to because it will slow down the process of escaping quickly.
They can, but only if they're able to pick them up quickly.
Ofcourse, they can.
No they can't.
No, they need to leave as soon as possible.
We instruct them to leave their belongings.
In the interest of safety, no.
Only small objects that are nearby and that they can grab quickly.
