This cold is messing up my plans.
I've thrown up twice today.
I am not sure what's wrong.  Probably something I ate.
I have been feeling depressed lately.
If I throw up again, I'm going to the hospital.
I have been very stressed out.
I might have the stomach virus that's going around.
I don't know. Hope it's nothing serious.
