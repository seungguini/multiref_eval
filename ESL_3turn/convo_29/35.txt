I have to have dental surgery in a few hours.
This cold is messing up my plans.
I'm scheduled for hernia surgery tomorrow.
I broke up with Steven and he's not taking it very well.
I have been feeling depressed lately.
If I throw up again, I'm going to the hospital.
I have been very stressed out.
I don't know. Hope it's nothing serious.
