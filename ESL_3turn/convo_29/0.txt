I've thrown up twice today.
I'm scheduled for hernia surgery tomorrow.
I am not sure what's wrong.  Probably something I ate.
I have been feeling depressed lately.
I have been very stressed out.
I might have the stomach virus that's going around.
I have a lot on my plate at the moment.
I don't know. Hope it's nothing serious.
