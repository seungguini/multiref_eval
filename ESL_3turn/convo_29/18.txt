I have to have dental surgery in a few hours.
I have been feeling very sick lately.
I broke up with Steven and he's not taking it very well.
I am not sure what's wrong.  Probably something I ate.
I have been very stressed out.
I might have the stomach virus that's going around.
I have a lot on my plate at the moment.
I don't know. Hope it's nothing serious.
