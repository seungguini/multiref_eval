I am so glad you did that.
That's good to know.
Oh good!
Well, fish it out.
Thats a great idea!
I wish you could remember to take your key if you remember to do that.
Where did you hide it?
Is it under a rock?
Do you forget your key often?
You're so smart!
That's so irresponsible.
I have thought about that before.
Good thinking!
I don't know what's worse--losing your key or leaving one hanging around.
Aren't your scared someone will break in?
Can you get it?
You really shouldn't rely on it.
