Well, fish it out.
I wish you could remember to take your key if you remember to do that.
Where did you hide it?
Do you forget your key often?
You're so smart!
I have thought about that before.
I don't know what's worse--losing your key or leaving one hanging around.
You really shouldn't rely on it.
