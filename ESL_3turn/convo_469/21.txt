What information do you need exactly?
I'm not giving you my information.
Hey, get off me.  You don't have the authority to stop me.
I don't know what to tell you.  I didn't see anything.
I'm confused, why do you need my information?
Can you remind me what information you need?
You're out of your mind.
It was just an accident.
