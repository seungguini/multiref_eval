I'm not giving you my information.
Hey, get off me.  You don't have the authority to stop me.
I don't know what to tell you.  I didn't see anything.
I'm confused, why do you need my information?
Why, there's no damage.
Can you remind me what information you need?
It was just an accident.
Here it is.
