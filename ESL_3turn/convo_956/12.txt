I'm excited for you, it's a great place to work.
That's great. She's cool. I think she'll like you a lot!
Good luck, I gave him a good recommendation.
A couple of things you should know about him. . .
That's awesome. Wear something green. It's her favorite color!
Great, I hope it all goes well.
I hope you get the job. I'd love to work with you.
What time are you meeting with him?
