I want to go somewhere where I can swim and wear my new bathing suit.
Well, we are going to have to compromise here then.
So somewhere like Norway?
Really, where were you thinking of?
Do you want it to be in the state?
I don't like being cold.
Do you have any places in mind?
What is your favorite cold place?
