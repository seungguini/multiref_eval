I want to go somewhere where I can swim and wear my new bathing suit.
I was thinking of the beach.
Well, we are going to have to compromise here then.
So somewhere like Norway?
I'm too cold and fresh right now.
I don't like being cold.
Do you have any places in mind?
What is your favorite cold place?
