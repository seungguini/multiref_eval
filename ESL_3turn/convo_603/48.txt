I want to go somewhere where I can swim and wear my new bathing suit.
So somewhere like Norway?
I want to lay in the sun all day.
Really, where were you thinking of?
Do you want it to be in the state?
Should we go somewhere cold in Europe?
Do you have any places in mind?
What is your favorite cold place?
