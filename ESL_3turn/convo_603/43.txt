I want to go somewhere where I can swim and wear my new bathing suit.
I was thinking of the beach.
I'm too cold and fresh right now.
I want to lay in the sun all day.
Really, where were you thinking of?
Do you want it to be in the state?
Do you have any places in mind?
What is your favorite cold place?
