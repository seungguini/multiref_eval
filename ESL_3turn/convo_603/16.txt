I want to go somewhere where I can swim and wear my new bathing suit.
Well, we are going to have to compromise here then.
So somewhere like Norway?
I want to lay in the sun all day.
Really, where were you thinking of?
Should we go somewhere cold in Europe?
Do you have any places in mind?
What is your favorite cold place?
