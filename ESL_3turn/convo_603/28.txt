I want to go somewhere where I can swim and wear my new bathing suit.
Well, we are going to have to compromise here then.
I want to lay in the sun all day.
Really, where were you thinking of?
Do you want it to be in the state?
I don't like being cold.
Do you have any places in mind?
What is your favorite cold place?
