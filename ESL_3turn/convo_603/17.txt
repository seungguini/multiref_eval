I want to go somewhere where I can swim and wear my new bathing suit.
I was thinking of the beach.
Well, we are going to have to compromise here then.
I'm too cold and fresh right now.
Do you want it to be in the state?
Should we go somewhere cold in Europe?
Do you have any places in mind?
What is your favorite cold place?
