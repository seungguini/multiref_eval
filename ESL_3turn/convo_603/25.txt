I want to go somewhere where I can swim and wear my new bathing suit.
Well, we are going to have to compromise here then.
So somewhere like Norway?
I'm too cold and fresh right now.
Really, where were you thinking of?
Do you want it to be in the state?
Should we go somewhere cold in Europe?
Do you have any places in mind?
