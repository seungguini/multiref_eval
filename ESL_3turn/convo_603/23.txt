I want to go somewhere where I can swim and wear my new bathing suit.
Well, we are going to have to compromise here then.
So somewhere like Norway?
I want to lay in the sun all day.
Really, where were you thinking of?
I don't like being cold.
Should we go somewhere cold in Europe?
What is your favorite cold place?
