Less of a hassle than buying new clothes constantly!
It's important to do your chores.
Then wear dirty clothes!
Get it out of the way so you don't have to do it later this week.
Don't be so lazy, everyone does laundry!
Everyone has to do laundry thought!
Quit complaining!
It's the worst. Might as well get it over with though.
