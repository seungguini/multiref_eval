It only takes about an hour.
Less of a hassle than buying new clothes constantly!
Then wear dirty clothes!
Get it out of the way so you don't have to do it later this week.
Don't be so lazy, everyone does laundry!
Have you thought about a drop off service?
Quit complaining!
It's the worst. Might as well get it over with though.
