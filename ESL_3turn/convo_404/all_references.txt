I can't wait to watch you play ball!
I appreciate that.
Great!
Thank you very much.
You'll do great, I'm excited to watch you play.
Save us good seats!
I am bringing the kids, so save alot of room.
That would be great.
I do not want to sit with your family.
I'm so excited!
I will be a little late.
It's going to be a lot of fun.
How do I get there?
I've never been to a baseball game before.
