Oh, for goodness sake, it's a construction job. They don't expect clean nails.
Do you have extra copies of your resume?
Yes, they're clean.
I wonder if another colored tie would be better.
Does everything else look okay?
Do you mean literally, or is that some weird euphemism for something?
My nails are always clean.
Yes, I just got them done.
