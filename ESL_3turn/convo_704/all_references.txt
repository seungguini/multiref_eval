Oh, for goodness sake, it's a construction job. They don't expect clean nails.
Do you have extra copies of your resume?
Yes, they're clean.
Yes, they are.
Yes.
I wonder if another colored tie would be better.
You're making me nervous.
Already checked them.
Yes, why?
Does everything else look okay?
Do you mean literally, or is that some weird euphemism for something?
They look good to me!
My nails are always clean.
Yes, I just got them done.
