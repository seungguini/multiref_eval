We have two really great  dog parks.
What do you want to know?
All the neighbors watch out for one another here.
Everyone is really friendly and help each other out.
There is a neighborhood potluck every month.
There's no crime.
The kids around here are great and it's pretty quiet on weekends.
Just look at the flowers.
