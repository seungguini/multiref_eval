It is very safe.
The neighbors are nice
All the neighbors watch out for one another here.
Everyone is very nice and very helpful.
There's no crime.
The kids around here are great and it's pretty quiet on weekends.
The good restaurants are close and the swimming pool is awesome.
Just look at the flowers.
