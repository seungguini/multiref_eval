I am not.  It has been a long week and I just want to relax.
You said you'd plan the date this time.
I am going to the football game on Sunday.
No I'm being totally serious.
What do you have planned?
I can't plan every single date, Karen.
I don't like to plan things out in advance.
No I'm too anal for that.
