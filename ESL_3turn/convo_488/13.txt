I am not.  It has been a long week and I just want to relax.
Why is that so surprising to you?
Nope, Sunday is a day of rest for me.
You said you'd plan the date this time.
No I'm being totally serious.
I can't plan every single date, Karen.
Of course I'm kidding.
I don't like to plan things out in advance.
