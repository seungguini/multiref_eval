I am not.  It has been a long week and I just want to relax.
Nope, Sunday is a day of rest for me.
I am going to the football game on Sunday.
What do you have planned?
I can't plan every single date, Karen.
Of course I'm kidding.
I don't like to plan things out in advance.
No I'm too anal for that.
