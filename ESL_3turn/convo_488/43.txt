I am not.  It has been a long week and I just want to relax.
Why is that so surprising to you?
You said you'd plan the date this time.
I am going to the football game on Sunday.
No I'm being totally serious.
What do you have planned?
I don't like to plan things out in advance.
No I'm too anal for that.
