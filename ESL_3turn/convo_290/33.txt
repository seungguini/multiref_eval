I thought that you might have purchased a vanity plate.
Yep, that's usually how that works.
Oh, I thought you had gotten a personalized license plate.
I like mine.  It has my lucky number in it.
It's still exciting to have a license.
Yes. I paid extra to have my own choice of numbers and letters.
Oh.  That's too bad.
