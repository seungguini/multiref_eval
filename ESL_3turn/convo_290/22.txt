Yes, I absolutely love it.
I guess it isn't really something to get excited over.
Yep, that's usually how that works.
Oh, I thought you had gotten a personalized license plate.
I like mine.  It has my lucky number in it.
Yeah! It's great.
It's still exciting to have a license.
Yes. I paid extra to have my own choice of numbers and letters.
