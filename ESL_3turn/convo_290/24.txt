Yes, I absolutely love it.
Next time get a vanity plate.
Why did it take so long to come in?
Yeah. I had it customized.
I guess it isn't really something to get excited over.
Yep, that's usually how that works.
Oh, I thought you had gotten a personalized license plate.
It's still exciting to have a license.
