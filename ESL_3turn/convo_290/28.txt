I thought that you might have purchased a vanity plate.
Next time get a vanity plate.
I guess it isn't really something to get excited over.
Yep, that's usually how that works.
Oh, I thought you had gotten a personalized license plate.
It's fine, it suits its purpose.
I like mine.  It has my lucky number in it.
It's still exciting to have a license.
