Yes, I absolutely love it.
I thought that you might have purchased a vanity plate.
Next time get a vanity plate.
Why did it take so long to come in?
Yeah. I had it customized.
I guess it isn't really something to get excited over.
Yep, that's usually how that works.
Oh, I thought you had gotten a personalized license plate.
It's fine, it suits its purpose.
I like mine.  It has my lucky number in it.
Yeah! It's great.
It's still exciting to have a license.
Yes. I paid extra to have my own choice of numbers and letters.
Oh.  That's too bad.
