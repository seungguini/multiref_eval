I thought that was a good story.
Ugh. Pathetic.
Like i said shouldn't even call it news.
That's one heck of a news!
What a dumb cat.
Who cares, really?
My cat does that everyday.
It's just wasting our time.
I think we are stupid for watching it.
I turned it off after the weather.
That's not even news.
They wouldn't do it if people didn't watch it.
Right. That's not news. Tell me something important.
They really need to show meaningful news.
I missed that one.
Slow night, I guess.
What a total joke.
