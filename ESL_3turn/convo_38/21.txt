Which one would you recommend?
Can we see a menu?
Do you have any suggestions for a good appetizer?
They all look delicious! I am not sure I can choose.
I heard that your nachos were good here.
Are the buffalo wings super hot?
There are too many choices!
I'll have a look at the menu if you have one!
