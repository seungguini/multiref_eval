Which one would you recommend?
Do you have any suggestions for a good appetizer?
They all look delicious! I am not sure I can choose.
Can I hear what your appetizers are?
Are the buffalo wings super hot?
Do you have any specials running for your appetizers?
There are too many choices!
I'll have a look at the menu if you have one!
