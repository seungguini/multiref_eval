So I can freeze some for later.
They are easier to cook that way.
Because it will not fit in my pot.
Because it was to large for my recipe
There is too much meat if they don't cut them in half.
Giving some to a friend for her family.
I like to eat them better when they are cut in half.
That's the way my husband likes them.
