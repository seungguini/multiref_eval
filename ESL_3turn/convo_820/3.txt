So I don't have to.
So I can freeze one half to use later.
They are easier to cook that way.
Makes them cook more quickly.
Because it will not fit in my pot.
There is too much meat if they don't cut them in half.
I like to eat them better when they are cut in half.
That's the way my husband likes them.
