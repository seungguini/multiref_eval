what kind of pain
Where did you get during the accident?
Alright. Let's do a short physical exam.
is it a throbbing pain or a stiff pain
Can you describe the pain for me?
did it come on suddenly or has it built up over time
Have you tried any stretching techniques?
I'm gonna do an x-ray to see if there's any strained muscle.
