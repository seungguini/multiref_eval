Alright. Let's do a short physical exam.
is it a throbbing pain or a stiff pain
How long have you been having this pain?
On a scale of 1-10 how much does it hurt?
Can you describe the pain for me?
did it come on suddenly or has it built up over time
Have you tried any stretching techniques?
tell me about the accident
