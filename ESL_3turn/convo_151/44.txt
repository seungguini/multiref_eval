Where did you get during the accident?
is it a throbbing pain or a stiff pain
How long have you been having this pain?
Can you describe the pain for me?
did it come on suddenly or has it built up over time
Have you tried any stretching techniques?
what kind of accident was it
I'm gonna do an x-ray to see if there's any strained muscle.
