what kind of pain
Where did you get during the accident?
How long have you noticed the pain?
is it a throbbing pain or a stiff pain
On a scale of 1-10 how much does it hurt?
Have you tried any stretching techniques?
what kind of accident was it
I'm gonna do an x-ray to see if there's any strained muscle.
