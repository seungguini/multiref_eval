I see it. I'll go ahead and cancel that table for 6 people at 6 p.m. this evening, under the name Carlos Jones.
Can I ask why you're cancelling?
I'll need some further information
ok and can you confirm your name please?
I don't have a reservation under that name.
I have to get my manager
We cannot cancel a reservation at this point
What was the time frame of your reservation?
