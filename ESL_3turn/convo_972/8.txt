I see it. I'll go ahead and cancel that table for 6 people at 6 p.m. this evening, under the name Carlos Jones.
thank you, and who am i speaking with.
Can I ask why you're cancelling?
I'll need some further information
ok and can you confirm your name please?
I don't see that. Is it for today?
OK, I've taken care of that cancellation. Would you like to reserve a table for a different day or time?
Is that the reservation for tomorrow at 7:30 pm?
