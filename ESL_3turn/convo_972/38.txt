thank you, and who am i speaking with.
Can I ask why you're cancelling?
I have to get my manager
I don't see that. Is it for today?
We cannot cancel a reservation at this point
OK, I've taken care of that cancellation. Would you like to reserve a table for a different day or time?
Is that the reservation for tomorrow at 7:30 pm?
What was the time frame of your reservation?
