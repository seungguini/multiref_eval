I see it. I'll go ahead and cancel that table for 6 people at 6 p.m. this evening, under the name Carlos Jones.
I don't have a reservation under that name.
I have to get my manager
I don't see that. Is it for today?
We cannot cancel a reservation at this point
When was your reservation booked?
Is that the reservation for tomorrow at 7:30 pm?
What was the time frame of your reservation?
