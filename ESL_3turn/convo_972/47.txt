I see it. I'll go ahead and cancel that table for 6 people at 6 p.m. this evening, under the name Carlos Jones.
thank you, and who am i speaking with.
I got that! Your reservation is now cancelled.
I don't have a reservation under that name.
I have to get my manager
I don't see that. Is it for today?
We cannot cancel a reservation at this point
OK, I've taken care of that cancellation. Would you like to reserve a table for a different day or time?
