Can I ask why you're cancelling?
I'll need some further information
I have to get my manager
I don't see that. Is it for today?
OK, I've taken care of that cancellation. Would you like to reserve a table for a different day or time?
When was your reservation booked?
What was the time frame of your reservation?
