I see it. I'll go ahead and cancel that table for 6 people at 6 p.m. this evening, under the name Carlos Jones.
thank you, and who am i speaking with.
Can I ask why you're cancelling?
I'll need some further information
I don't have a reservation under that name.
When was your reservation booked?
Is that the reservation for tomorrow at 7:30 pm?
What was the time frame of your reservation?
