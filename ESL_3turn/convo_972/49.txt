I see it. I'll go ahead and cancel that table for 6 people at 6 p.m. this evening, under the name Carlos Jones.
Can I ask why you're cancelling?
I got that! Your reservation is now cancelled.
I have to get my manager
I don't see that. Is it for today?
OK, I've taken care of that cancellation. Would you like to reserve a table for a different day or time?
Is that the reservation for tomorrow at 7:30 pm?
What was the time frame of your reservation?
