I see it. I'll go ahead and cancel that table for 6 people at 6 p.m. this evening, under the name Carlos Jones.
Can I ask why you're cancelling?
I'll need some further information
I got that! Your reservation is now cancelled.
I don't have a reservation under that name.
I have to get my manager
When was your reservation booked?
What was the time frame of your reservation?
