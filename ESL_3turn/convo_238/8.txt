thats not too bad considering
Have you been under more stress?
That is not unusual, you are still growing.
Have you done something different this month?
Thats nothing too alarming. Have you tried counting calories
Maybe you should come walking with me.
Did you check if you are pregnant?
Have you been eating a lot?
