Did his parents leave a phone number where they can be reached?
Just give him some aspirin.
We should call his parents to see how they would like us to treat it.
Children's Tylenol should be okay.
I know, this is kind of scary.
We could monitor David and if he seems to get worse, contact his parents.
Give him some cold medicine and let him get some rest.
I'll make him some chicken noodle soup.
