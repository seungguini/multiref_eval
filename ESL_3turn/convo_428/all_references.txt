My birthday.
Seeing all of the gang at the party!
I haven't seen my friends in so long.
I just told you.
I am looking forward to going on vacation.
David's delicious BBQ!
I love their pool!
What is that mean?
I want to see the look on his face when he opens my present!
Why are you being so critical?
Are you picking a fight with me?
Let's not talk about it.
