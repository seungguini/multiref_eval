I think the dog ran across the carpet.
The dog tracked it in.
I do not know.
It wasn't me.
That's odd because I did wipe my feet.
Maybe it got on my shoes by accident.
Maybe you drug it in?
Ask your kids.
I'll clean it up for you.
It was an accident; I thought I got it all off.
The dog track that in.
I am sorry, I will clean it up.
It's not my fault.
I do not see any mud.
Check the bottom of your own shoes.
