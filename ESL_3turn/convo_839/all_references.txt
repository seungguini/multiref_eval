What did you do?
Well, he's not wrong.
You are kind of irresponsible.
Makes sense.
How did he explain that?
That really sucks.
You just don't care.
What? You are very responsible.
I'm sorry.
You get lazy sometimes.
You'll find something else.
Does he know who he's talking to?
That sucks.  Hope you find something else soon.
He's crazy.
You'll find a better job.
