I didn't.
Let me think about it.
No, but I heard car thefts are on the rise in our area.

Yes, there was a guy walking up and down our street that I didn't recognize.
I think there were some guys in the parking lot, now that you mention it.
No, but maybe another neighbor did?
Not that I can remember.
