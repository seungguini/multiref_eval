No I was at work yesterday.
Maybe, what is it worth to you?
No I didn't, but I can check my security cameras.
It wasn't me so stop bothering me.
No, but I heard car thefts are on the rise in our area.
What are you implying?
I think there were some guys in the parking lot, now that you mention it.
No, but maybe another neighbor did?
