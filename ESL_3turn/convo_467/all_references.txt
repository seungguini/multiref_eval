No I was at work yesterday.
I didn't.
Not that I can recall.
I wasn't here yesterday.
Maybe, what is it worth to you?
I wasn't around yesterday.
No I didn't, but I can check my security cameras.
Let me think about it.
It wasn't me so stop bothering me.
No, but I'll ask around for you.
No, but I heard car thefts are on the rise in our area.
What are you implying?
Yes, there was a guy walking up and down our street that I didn't recognize.
I think there were some guys in the parking lot, now that you mention it.
No, but maybe another neighbor did?
Not that I can remember.
