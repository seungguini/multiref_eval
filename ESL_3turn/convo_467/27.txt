No I was at work yesterday.
Not that I can recall.
No I didn't, but I can check my security cameras.
It wasn't me so stop bothering me.
What are you implying?
Yes, there was a guy walking up and down our street that I didn't recognize.
I think there were some guys in the parking lot, now that you mention it.
Not that I can remember.
