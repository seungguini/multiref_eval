No I was at work yesterday.
I didn't.
Not that I can recall.
Maybe, what is it worth to you?
No, but I heard car thefts are on the rise in our area.
Yes, there was a guy walking up and down our street that I didn't recognize.
I think there were some guys in the parking lot, now that you mention it.
No, but maybe another neighbor did?
