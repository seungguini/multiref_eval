Maybe, what is it worth to you?
No I didn't, but I can check my security cameras.
It wasn't me so stop bothering me.
No, but I'll ask around for you.
Yes, there was a guy walking up and down our street that I didn't recognize.
I think there were some guys in the parking lot, now that you mention it.
No, but maybe another neighbor did?
Not that I can remember.
