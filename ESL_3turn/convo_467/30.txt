Not that I can recall.
I wasn't here yesterday.
No I didn't, but I can check my security cameras.
Let me think about it.
No, but I heard car thefts are on the rise in our area.
Yes, there was a guy walking up and down our street that I didn't recognize.
I think there were some guys in the parking lot, now that you mention it.
Not that I can remember.
