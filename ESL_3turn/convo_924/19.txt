Excuse me? I'm only being realistic.
Are you telling the truth?
Are you kidding me?
Well I wouldn't be so confused if you didn't date so many girls.
I'm never confused pal.
Really? Do you know my IQ is 150?
If anybodies confused here it's you. You date more women than anybody I've ever met.
I can't help it that I'm studying twice as much as anyone else.
