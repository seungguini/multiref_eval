Are you telling the truth?
Five in the last month isn't that many girls?
Are you kidding me?
Well I wouldn't be so confused if you didn't date so many girls.
Really? Do you know my IQ is 150?
I'm just kidding around with you. Sarah is a cool chick.
If anybodies confused here it's you. You date more women than anybody I've ever met.
I can't help it that I'm studying twice as much as anyone else.
