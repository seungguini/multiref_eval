Excuse me? I'm only being realistic.
Well, yes, that's true. But I still don't know Sarah.
Are you kidding me?
Well I wouldn't be so confused if you didn't date so many girls.
I'm never confused pal.
Really? Do you know my IQ is 150?
I can't help it that I'm studying twice as much as anyone else.
Seriously, which one's Sarah?
