Five in the last month isn't that many girls?
Meh, I don't really care.
Are you kidding me?
Well I wouldn't be so confused if you didn't date so many girls.
I'm never confused pal.
If anybodies confused here it's you. You date more women than anybody I've ever met.
Are you excluding one night stand girls?
I can't help it that I'm studying twice as much as anyone else.
