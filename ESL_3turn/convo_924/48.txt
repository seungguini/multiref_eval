Yeah, 'cause all the girls you date look alike.
Are you telling the truth?
Well, yes, that's true. But I still don't know Sarah.
Five in the last month isn't that many girls?
Meh, I don't really care.
Are you kidding me?
Well I wouldn't be so confused if you didn't date so many girls.
Seriously, which one's Sarah?
