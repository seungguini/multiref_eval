Excuse me? I'm only being realistic.
Are you telling the truth?
Well, yes, that's true. But I still don't know Sarah.
Are you kidding me?
Well I wouldn't be so confused if you didn't date so many girls.
Really? Do you know my IQ is 150?
I'm just kidding around with you. Sarah is a cool chick.
Seriously, which one's Sarah?
