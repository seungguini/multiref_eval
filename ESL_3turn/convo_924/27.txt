Yeah, 'cause all the girls you date look alike.
Are you telling the truth?
Well, yes, that's true. But I still don't know Sarah.
Five in the last month isn't that many girls?
Are you kidding me?
Well I wouldn't be so confused if you didn't date so many girls.
Really? Do you know my IQ is 150?
If anybodies confused here it's you. You date more women than anybody I've ever met.
