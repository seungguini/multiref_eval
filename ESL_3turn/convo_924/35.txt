Excuse me? I'm only being realistic.
Yeah, 'cause all the girls you date look alike.
Are you telling the truth?
Five in the last month isn't that many girls?
Meh, I don't really care.
Well I wouldn't be so confused if you didn't date so many girls.
Really? Do you know my IQ is 150?
Are you excluding one night stand girls?
