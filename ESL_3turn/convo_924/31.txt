Excuse me? I'm only being realistic.
Yeah, 'cause all the girls you date look alike.
Well, yes, that's true. But I still don't know Sarah.
Are you kidding me?
Well I wouldn't be so confused if you didn't date so many girls.
I'm never confused pal.
I'm just kidding around with you. Sarah is a cool chick.
Are you excluding one night stand girls?
