Yeah, 'cause all the girls you date look alike.
Well, yes, that's true. But I still don't know Sarah.
Meh, I don't really care.
Are you kidding me?
Well I wouldn't be so confused if you didn't date so many girls.
I'm never confused pal.
Really? Do you know my IQ is 150?
If anybodies confused here it's you. You date more women than anybody I've ever met.
