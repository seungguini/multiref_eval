Excuse me? I'm only being realistic.
Yeah, 'cause all the girls you date look alike.
Are you telling the truth?
Well, yes, that's true. But I still don't know Sarah.
Really? Do you know my IQ is 150?
If anybodies confused here it's you. You date more women than anybody I've ever met.
Are you excluding one night stand girls?
I can't help it that I'm studying twice as much as anyone else.
