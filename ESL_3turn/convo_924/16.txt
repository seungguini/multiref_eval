Yeah, 'cause all the girls you date look alike.
Well, yes, that's true. But I still don't know Sarah.
Five in the last month isn't that many girls?
Really? Do you know my IQ is 150?
I'm just kidding around with you. Sarah is a cool chick.
If anybodies confused here it's you. You date more women than anybody I've ever met.
Are you excluding one night stand girls?
Seriously, which one's Sarah?
