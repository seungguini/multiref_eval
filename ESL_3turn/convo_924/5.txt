Excuse me? I'm only being realistic.
Are you telling the truth?
Well, yes, that's true. But I still don't know Sarah.
Well I wouldn't be so confused if you didn't date so many girls.
Really? Do you know my IQ is 150?
If anybodies confused here it's you. You date more women than anybody I've ever met.
Are you excluding one night stand girls?
Seriously, which one's Sarah?
