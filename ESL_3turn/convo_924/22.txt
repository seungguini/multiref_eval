Well, yes, that's true. But I still don't know Sarah.
Meh, I don't really care.
Are you kidding me?
I'm never confused pal.
Really? Do you know my IQ is 150?
I'm just kidding around with you. Sarah is a cool chick.
If anybodies confused here it's you. You date more women than anybody I've ever met.
I can't help it that I'm studying twice as much as anyone else.
