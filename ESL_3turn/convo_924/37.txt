Excuse me? I'm only being realistic.
Yeah, 'cause all the girls you date look alike.
Well, yes, that's true. But I still don't know Sarah.
Five in the last month isn't that many girls?
Meh, I don't really care.
Are you kidding me?
I'm just kidding around with you. Sarah is a cool chick.
Seriously, which one's Sarah?
