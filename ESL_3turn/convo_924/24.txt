Yeah, 'cause all the girls you date look alike.
Five in the last month isn't that many girls?
Well I wouldn't be so confused if you didn't date so many girls.
I'm never confused pal.
I'm just kidding around with you. Sarah is a cool chick.
Are you excluding one night stand girls?
I can't help it that I'm studying twice as much as anyone else.
