Excuse me? I'm only being realistic.
Meh, I don't really care.
Are you kidding me?
Well I wouldn't be so confused if you didn't date so many girls.
Really? Do you know my IQ is 150?
If anybodies confused here it's you. You date more women than anybody I've ever met.
I can't help it that I'm studying twice as much as anyone else.
Seriously, which one's Sarah?
