Excuse me? I'm only being realistic.
Well, yes, that's true. But I still don't know Sarah.
Meh, I don't really care.
Are you kidding me?

I'm just kidding around with you. Sarah is a cool chick.
Are you excluding one night stand girls?
I can't help it that I'm studying twice as much as anyone else.
