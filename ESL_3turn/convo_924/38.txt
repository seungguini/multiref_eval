Well, yes, that's true. But I still don't know Sarah.
Five in the last month isn't that many girls?
Meh, I don't really care.
Well I wouldn't be so confused if you didn't date so many girls.
I'm never confused pal.
Really? Do you know my IQ is 150?
If anybodies confused here it's you. You date more women than anybody I've ever met.
Seriously, which one's Sarah?
