Excuse me? I'm only being realistic.
Yeah, 'cause all the girls you date look alike.
Are you telling the truth?
Well, yes, that's true. But I still don't know Sarah.
Five in the last month isn't that many girls?
Meh, I don't really care.
Are you kidding me?
Well I wouldn't be so confused if you didn't date so many girls.
I'm never confused pal.
Really? Do you know my IQ is 150?
I'm just kidding around with you. Sarah is a cool chick.
If anybodies confused here it's you. You date more women than anybody I've ever met.
Are you excluding one night stand girls?
I can't help it that I'm studying twice as much as anyone else.
Seriously, which one's Sarah?
