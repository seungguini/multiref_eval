Excuse me? I'm only being realistic.
Are you telling the truth?
Well, yes, that's true. But I still don't know Sarah.
Five in the last month isn't that many girls?
Meh, I don't really care.
Are you kidding me?
Well I wouldn't be so confused if you didn't date so many girls.
I can't help it that I'm studying twice as much as anyone else.
