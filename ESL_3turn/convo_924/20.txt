Are you telling the truth?
Well, yes, that's true. But I still don't know Sarah.
Meh, I don't really care.
Well I wouldn't be so confused if you didn't date so many girls.
I'm never confused pal.
Really? Do you know my IQ is 150?
Are you excluding one night stand girls?
Seriously, which one's Sarah?
