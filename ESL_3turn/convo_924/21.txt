Excuse me? I'm only being realistic.
Well, yes, that's true. But I still don't know Sarah.
Meh, I don't really care.
Well I wouldn't be so confused if you didn't date so many girls.
If anybodies confused here it's you. You date more women than anybody I've ever met.
Are you excluding one night stand girls?
I can't help it that I'm studying twice as much as anyone else.
Seriously, which one's Sarah?
