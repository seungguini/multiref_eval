If it's warm let's go.
You don't even know?!
Okay, let me know how it is.
I thought it was going to rain today.
I would prefer warm if we are walking.
Good luck with that.
Let me know if it's not too hot. I don't want to walk in the heat.
Let me know.
We could just sit inside instead?
Is it too hot?
Where were you thinking about walking?
