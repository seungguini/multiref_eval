It's not really free. They just include it in the price.
I love hotels with a free breakfast!
Hmm, I'd rather have free wi-fi.
Hopefully lots of coffee as well.
Finding a complimentary breakfast is a good way to get the best value out of a hotel.
What else made you feel positive about this hotel?
Such as it is.
Yeah, free breakfast is a big plus.
