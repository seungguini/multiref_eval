This is exactly the look you asked for.
I'm sorry you're unhappy, but I gave you exactly what you asked for.
There is nothing I can do now, sorry.
Is it too short?
I've been cutting hair for ten years, and I have never been so insulted before.
Oh sorry, I didn't hear properly.
I'm sorry that you don't like it.   Will you let me try to fix it?
I'm going to get fired if I can't find a way to fix your hair.
