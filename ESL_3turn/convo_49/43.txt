All that water crashing down on to the rocks freaks me out.
The water at the bottom can pull you under, and you could drown.
I fell into one when I was a kid. I almost drowned.
The water is moving so fast.
I'm worried I'll be boating down a river, and suddenly fall down a water fall.
They're too loud and distracting and make it hard to notice attackers.
I'm afraid that I might drown in one.
I have this weird fear of falling over one and drowning.
