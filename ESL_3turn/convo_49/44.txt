All that water crashing down on to the rocks freaks me out.
The water at the bottom can pull you under, and you could drown.
I fell into one when I was a kid. I almost drowned.
They are very big and overwhelming.
The water is moving so fast.
I'm afraid that I might drown in one.
They are very loud and powerful.
I went to Niagara Falls and they have made me nervous ever since.
