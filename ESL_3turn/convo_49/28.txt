All that water crashing down on to the rocks freaks me out.
I fell into one when I was a kid. I almost drowned.
They are very big and overwhelming.
I'm worried I'll be boating down a river, and suddenly fall down a water fall.
I'm afraid that I might drown in one.
I have this weird fear of falling over one and drowning.
They are very loud and powerful.
I went to Niagara Falls and they have made me nervous ever since.
