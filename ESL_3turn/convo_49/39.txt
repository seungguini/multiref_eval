All that water crashing down on to the rocks freaks me out.
The water at the bottom can pull you under, and you could drown.
They are very big and overwhelming.
The water is moving so fast.
I'm worried I'll be boating down a river, and suddenly fall down a water fall.
They're too loud and distracting and make it hard to notice attackers.
I'm afraid that I might drown in one.
They are very loud and powerful.
