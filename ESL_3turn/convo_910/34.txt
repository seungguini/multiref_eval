I started running every day.
I have been hitting the gym recently.
I found this great undergarment I could tell you where to get one.
I stopped eating meat.
I gave up beer, and started to eat more vegetables.
I started to watch what I eat and move more.
I began running again.
I have been playing basketball three times a week.
