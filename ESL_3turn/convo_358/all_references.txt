We wont' make it with that attitude.
He doesn't even see us.
We might if we rush.
Yes we can. Run fast.
If we go now, we'll definitely make it.
I think he's stopping.
You're probably right.   What time is the next bus?
I think we can make it if we're quick.
Stop complaining and MOVE!
Hurry up there's not another one for an hour.
I think you are right.
Be careful of that car.
