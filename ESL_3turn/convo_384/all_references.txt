I'm too tired.
Haha, very funny, Sarah. Now get up.
You're going to be late.
I think I'm trapped!
I don't want to go to school.
I'm not falling for that again, Sarah!
If you go back to bed you'll miss all the fun today.
Please, help me!
Seriously?
Then I'll pry the blankets off you.
You should be a comedian.
