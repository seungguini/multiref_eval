That happens.
Nope, I have it.
Nope, I got it.
Nope, I got it. Thanks
Nope, I got your invitation.
I was starting to think I wasn't invited!
I thought it was supposed to be on the 15th.
Yeah, but I can't come, sorry.
Don't worry I'll be at your party.
I can't wait till it happens.
You must be really looking forward to it.
Is everyone coming?
