Being 16 means you are not a child anymore.
You're young and free.
You are a teenager and not a little kid.
I don't know, it just seemed like the right thing to say.
You don't feel tired all the time and you don't have anything to worry about!
You are one step closer to adulthood.
You are nearly an adult now!
The world is your oyster.
