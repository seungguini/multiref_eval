Being 16 means you are not a child anymore.
You're young and free.
You are a teenager and not a little kid.
You can get your driver's license.
I don't know, it just seemed like the right thing to say.
You are nearly an adult now!
You will have some more freedoms.
You are young and do not feel old yet.
