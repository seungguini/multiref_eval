Being 16 means you are not a child anymore.
You are a teenager and not a little kid.
I don't know, it just seemed like the right thing to say.
You start getting more freedom from your parents.
You are one step closer to adulthood.
You are nearly an adult now!
You are young and do not feel old yet.
The world is your oyster.
