Being 16 means you are not a child anymore.
You're young and free.
You are a teenager and not a little kid.
You can get your driver's license.
You don't feel tired all the time and you don't have anything to worry about!
You start getting more freedom from your parents.
You get your license!
The world is your oyster.
