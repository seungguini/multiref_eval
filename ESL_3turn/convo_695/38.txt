Being 16 means you are not a child anymore.
You are a teenager and not a little kid.
I don't know, it just seemed like the right thing to say.
You don't feel tired all the time and you don't have anything to worry about!
You start getting more freedom from your parents.
You get your license!
You are young and do not feel old yet.
The world is your oyster.
