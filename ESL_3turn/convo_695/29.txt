Being 16 means you are not a child anymore.
You are a teenager and not a little kid.
You can get your driver's license.
You start getting more freedom from your parents.
You are one step closer to adulthood.
You will have some more freedoms.
You are young and do not feel old yet.
The world is your oyster.
