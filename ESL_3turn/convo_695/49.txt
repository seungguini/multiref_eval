Being 16 means you are not a child anymore.
You can get your driver's license.
You don't feel tired all the time and you don't have anything to worry about!
You start getting more freedom from your parents.
You are nearly an adult now!
You get your license!
You are young and do not feel old yet.
The world is your oyster.
