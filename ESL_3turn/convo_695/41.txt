Being 16 means you are not a child anymore.
You're young and free.
You are a teenager and not a little kid.
You don't feel tired all the time and you don't have anything to worry about!
You are nearly an adult now!
You get your license!
You will have some more freedoms.
You are young and do not feel old yet.
