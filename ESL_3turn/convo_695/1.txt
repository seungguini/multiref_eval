Being 16 means you are not a child anymore.
You're young and free.
You are a teenager and not a little kid.
You can get your driver's license.
You don't feel tired all the time and you don't have anything to worry about!
You are one step closer to adulthood.
You will have some more freedoms.
The world is your oyster.
