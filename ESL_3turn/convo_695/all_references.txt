Being 16 means you are not a child anymore.
You're young and free.
You are a teenager and not a little kid.
You can get your driver's license.
I don't know, it just seemed like the right thing to say.
You don't feel tired all the time and you don't have anything to worry about!
You start getting more freedom from your parents.
You are one step closer to adulthood.
You are nearly an adult now!
You get your license!
You will have some more freedoms.
You are young and do not feel old yet.
The world is your oyster.
