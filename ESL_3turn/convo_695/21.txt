You are a teenager and not a little kid.
You can get your driver's license.
You don't feel tired all the time and you don't have anything to worry about!
You start getting more freedom from your parents.
You are one step closer to adulthood.
You are nearly an adult now!
You are young and do not feel old yet.
The world is your oyster.
