Being 16 means you are not a child anymore.
You're young and free.
You can get your driver's license.
I don't know, it just seemed like the right thing to say.
You don't feel tired all the time and you don't have anything to worry about!
You get your license!
You are young and do not feel old yet.
The world is your oyster.
