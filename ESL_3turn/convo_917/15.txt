You would be better off finding a shuttle I have to work.
What time do you want to get there?
Sorry, I have work in the morning.
Alright, I can swing that. Will you pay for gas?
Sure, I'm available.
Ok, let's leave around 8.
How long does it take to get there?
No, traffic will be horrendous at that time.
