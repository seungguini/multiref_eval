Okay now that is SO NOT TRUE.
That seems sexist. I would never.
You better not cheat on me!
Sexist much?
I would never do that to you. I love you.
That's not true. I'd never do that.
And you don't think there are women that like to cheat?
That's funny, considering your boyfriend broke up with you because you cheated.
