What were your favorite ideas?
Were there any points you didn't like?
If you need me to explain anything, I'll be happy to do so.
The idea you had to make the most sales.
Which idea did you like the best?
Did you have any questions about it?
I've really been thinking about these ideas for awhile now.
Can I take you to lunch so we can discuss these?
