how do you know?
No doubt. You get so nervous in front of strangers.
What did you do?
time for a new girlfriend?
Were they nice?
Maybe they were just having a bad day. I bet they warm up to you soon.
Did you talk to your girlfriend about it?
Well, maybe it doesn't really matter. You're not dating them, just their daughter.
