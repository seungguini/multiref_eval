I bet that's not really true.
how do you know?
time for a new girlfriend?
Were they nice?
Maybe they were just having a bad day. I bet they warm up to you soon.
What happened?
Did you talk to your girlfriend about it?
Well, maybe it doesn't really matter. You're not dating them, just their daughter.
