No, not at all.
Yes, the last tenant was hardly ever home.
I can't complain, the previous tenant was very responsible.
Yes they did. They were good tenants.
Yes, they did.
I think the previous tenant did their best, there are a few damages that can be easily fixed.
They were a little messy but nothing ever broke.
The last tenant was actually a handy man so this place needed no work at all after he left.
