No, not at all.
Yes, the last tenant was hardly ever home.
I can't complain, the previous tenant was very responsible.
Yes they did. They were good tenants.
The last tenant was great! I had no problems with them
They were a little messy but nothing ever broke.
The last tenant was actually a handy man so this place needed no work at all after he left.
He was one of the worst tenants I've ever had. He made no effort to maintain the apartment.
