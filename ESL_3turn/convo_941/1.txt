It's white and cold.
It's very cold, and sometimes it's packable for making snowballs.
It can turn into a sheet of ice if you do not shovel it quickly.
It's beautiful to look at but awful to drive in.
It is white.
I'ts nice, kind of peaceful and pretty if the flakes are large
I'ts great, but gets old fast too.
It is fun to build a snowman with.
