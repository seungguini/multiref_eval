It's cold and white and soft!
It is very fluffy.
It can turn into a sheet of ice if you do not shovel it quickly.
It's beautiful to look at but awful to drive in.
It's wonderful.  Everything seems so peaceful and quiet whenever it snows.
I'ts nice, kind of peaceful and pretty if the flakes are large
It is cold.
I'ts great, but gets old fast too.
