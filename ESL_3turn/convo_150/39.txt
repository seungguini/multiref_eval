She was a sweet villain type character in the Batman movie.
It could be a super villain, but it also could be a plant?
She always had on green with red hair.
I'm not sure but it sounds like a super villain.
A character that came from the comic books.

She was a kind of sassy woman type villain.
sorry . yeah . it's a plant that gives you a rash . like poison oak
