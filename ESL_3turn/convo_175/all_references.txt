But I don't want to.
Where's the bathroom?
But I don't want to walk to the bathroom
i am too lazy
Leave me alone. Let me live my life.
But it's so far away.
Okay
the bathroom is being used.
Or I could wipe it on you.
But that bathroom is out of the way
that's so much trouble.
But my sleeve works just fine
we need to buy more tissues.
Why don't you get me a tissue?
you wanna get it for me?
