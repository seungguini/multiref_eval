Yes, coffee is tastes good.  But too much is bad for you.
And so do you
But you don't love going to the bathroom.
The bathroom is down the hall and to the left.
Coffee is dehydrating; for every cup of coffee you drink you should also drink a cup of water.
Doesn't it get annoying though?
Coffee is good for the soul
It does my body good
