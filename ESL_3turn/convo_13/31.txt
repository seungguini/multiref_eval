Yes, coffee is tastes good.  But too much is bad for you.
And so do you
But you don't love going to the bathroom.
The bathroom is down the hall and to the left.
Coffee keeps me awake
Coffee is dehydrating; for every cup of coffee you drink you should also drink a cup of water.
Maybe you should try some
It does my body good
