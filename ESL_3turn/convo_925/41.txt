Don't ask me, I don't know either.
The important thing is we live well.
We live for new experiences.
To live is to suffer.
Maybe the point of living is to help others.
The point is not just to live but to live well.
I don't know. But here we are, so I guess we might as well make the best of it.
Hell if I know.
