The important thing is we live well.
We live for new experiences.
You figure it out.
To live is to suffer.

What happened? Did you break up with Sarah?
I don't know. But here we are, so I guess we might as well make the best of it.
We cannot live by bread alone. We need at least TV, girls and beer.
