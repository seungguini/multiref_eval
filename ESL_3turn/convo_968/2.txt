That is disgusting!
We don't have roach problems here. I bet you saw a rat.
I'm so sorry. I'll let housekeeping know.
That's impossible, we never had bugs in here.
I am terribly sorry, we will take care of that roach ASAP. Also, we will comp your room.
I'm very frightened of bugs.
I'm so sorry to hear that.
That is terrible, Sir.
