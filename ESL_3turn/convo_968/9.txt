That is disgusting!
We don't have roach problems here. I bet you saw a rat.
That's impossible, we never had bugs in here.
Okay, I can help you get rid of it.
I am terribly sorry, we will take care of that roach ASAP. Also, we will comp your room.
I'm very frightened of bugs.
I'm so sorry to hear that.
That is terrible, Sir.
