That sounds incredible.
I wish I could go to Italy!
That's extremely exciting!
Make sure you take lots of pictures.
When will you be returning?
Will you be getting school credit for your studies there?
That's going to be amazing to see the country.
Italy is one of the most beautiful sounding places in the world.
