If you get a prepaid pass, you save a little money on the fare.
That's a lot.
Maybe you can get a ride from someone instead.
I can get you a discount if you're connecting to another city bus.
Wow, that's rough.  Maybe you should get a bike or something.
I hope you have a good job.
Do you have ten dollars?
Have you considered buying a year-long bus pass?
