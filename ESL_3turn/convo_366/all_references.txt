I started dating in Middle School
I can date when I want.
I've been dating since I was 12 years old.
Whenever I feel ready to!
I've always dated, it's nothing new for me.
They told me seventeen.
Whenever I want.
My sixteenth birthday.
Nobody asks me out on a date.
After I turn eighteen.
Tonight.
My parents don't tell me when I can and can't date someone!
I don't know I'll let you know.
Right now!
