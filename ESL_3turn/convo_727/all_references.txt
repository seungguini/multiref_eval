I will go try them on.
They look a little small.
Me too!
Gee thanks, bitch.
What size are they?
Those are huge.
I tried them on.
Why wouldn't they fit?
They look the right size.
They should.
Yeah, I know, I'm fat.
Me too, they look small.
If not, I can return them.
You really ought to learn how to socialize sometime.
Well either you or me should be able to wear them.
They fit well in the store.
You're such an asshole.
