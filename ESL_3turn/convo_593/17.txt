That's a great idea.
are you eating breakfast?
Having small meals throughout the day should help!
be careful you might get fat
I recommend healthy snacks, like nuts.
I have a mini fridge, if you want to store your snacks!
what if your coworkers want some?
Make sure to include some protein in your snacks.
