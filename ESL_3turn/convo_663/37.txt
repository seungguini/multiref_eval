They've changed the paint color
No, the color scheme is all different I almost didn't recognize it.
It doesn't have the same menu.
The whole layout is different.
I think something is different, but I can't put a finger on what.
They haven't done much.
It looks pretty similar.
Yes, but it seems much darker in here than before.
