It looks like they haven't changed a thing.
From what I remember it does look the same.
No, the color scheme is all different I almost didn't recognize it.
It doesn't have the same menu.
The whole layout is different.
I think something is different, but I can't put a finger on what.
No, they have changed a lot in the past two years.
It looks pretty similar.
