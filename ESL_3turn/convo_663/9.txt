It looks like they haven't changed a thing.
They've changed the paint color
From what I remember it does look the same.
No, the color scheme is all different I almost didn't recognize it.
It doesn't have the same menu.
I think something is different, but I can't put a finger on what.
It looks the same hopefully it will taste the same too!
Yes, but it seems much darker in here than before.
