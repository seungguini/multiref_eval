They've changed the paint color
No, the color scheme is all different I almost didn't recognize it.
I think something is different, but I can't put a finger on what.
They haven't done much.
No, they have changed a lot in the past two years.
It looks pretty similar.
It looks the same hopefully it will taste the same too!
Everything is the same.
