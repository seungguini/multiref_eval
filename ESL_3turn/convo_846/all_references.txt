Make sure you rest enough.
I'm sure you will.
If you over do it, you may not be able to race.
No pain, no gain!
Don't wear yourself out.
Where is the race?
You always do well in your races.
Well, practice makes perfect.
How long is the race?
Are you stretching enough before you run?
What day is the race?
I'm sure you'll do great!
