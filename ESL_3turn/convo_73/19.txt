I washed all of the socks that were in the hamper.
I washed everything.
I took care of the sheets in the guest room and the bathroom towels.
I only washed the towels.
Just my stuff.
Everything that was on the bathroom floor.
Whatever was in the basket in the laundry room.
I mostly just washed some towels and wash cloths.
