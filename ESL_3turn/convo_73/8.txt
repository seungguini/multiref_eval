I washed all of the socks that were in the hamper.
I took care of the sheets in the guest room and the bathroom towels.
Just my stuff.
Everything that was on the bathroom floor.
Whatever was in the basket in the laundry room.
I washed all the sheets.
I washed a lot of socks and underwear.
I mostly just washed some towels and wash cloths.
