Oh, that's too bad.
Were you working on the big project for work?
Try to get some sleep.
If you hadn't procrastinated all semester, you wouldn't have had that problem.
Were you able to finish what you were doing?
I hope you feel better soon.
Do you need an energy drink?
Why were you working so late last night?
