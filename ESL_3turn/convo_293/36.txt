Maybe you can head home early today.
If you hadn't procrastinated all semester, you wouldn't have had that problem.
Were you able to finish what you were doing?
Here, have another cup of coffee.
I hope you feel better soon.
Do you need an energy drink?
Why were you working so late last night?
Hopefully you can catch up tonight.
