Oh, that's too bad.
Maybe you can head home early today.
Did you have a deadline?
Try to get some sleep.
If you hadn't procrastinated all semester, you wouldn't have had that problem.
Well, try to get to bed earlier tonight.
You'll feel better as soon as you get some sleep.
I hope you feel better soon.
