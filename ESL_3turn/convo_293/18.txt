Maybe you can head home early today.
Were you able to finish what you were doing?
You'll feel better as soon as you get some sleep.
Here, have another cup of coffee.
I hope you feel better soon.
Do you need an energy drink?
Why were you working so late last night?
Hopefully you can catch up tonight.
