Oh, that's too bad.
Were you working on the big project for work?
Maybe you can head home early today.
Well, try to get to bed earlier tonight.
You'll feel better as soon as you get some sleep.
I hope you feel better soon.
Why were you working so late last night?
Hopefully you can catch up tonight.
