Did you have a deadline?
If you hadn't procrastinated all semester, you wouldn't have had that problem.
Well, try to get to bed earlier tonight.
Were you able to finish what you were doing?
Here, have another cup of coffee.
I hope you feel better soon.
Why were you working so late last night?
Hopefully you can catch up tonight.
