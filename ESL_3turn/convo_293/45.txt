Did you have a deadline?
Try to get some sleep.
If you hadn't procrastinated all semester, you wouldn't have had that problem.
Were you able to finish what you were doing?
You'll feel better as soon as you get some sleep.
Here, have another cup of coffee.
Do you need an energy drink?
Hopefully you can catch up tonight.
