Were you working on the big project for work?
Maybe you can head home early today.
Did you have a deadline?
If you hadn't procrastinated all semester, you wouldn't have had that problem.
Were you able to finish what you were doing?
Here, have another cup of coffee.
Do you need an energy drink?
Hopefully you can catch up tonight.
