Maybe you can head home early today.
Did you have a deadline?
Try to get some sleep.
If you hadn't procrastinated all semester, you wouldn't have had that problem.
Were you able to finish what you were doing?
Here, have another cup of coffee.
Why were you working so late last night?
Hopefully you can catch up tonight.
