Oh, that's too bad.
Try to get some sleep.
If you hadn't procrastinated all semester, you wouldn't have had that problem.
Were you able to finish what you were doing?
You'll feel better as soon as you get some sleep.
Do you need an energy drink?
Why were you working so late last night?
Hopefully you can catch up tonight.
