Were you working on the big project for work?
Maybe you can head home early today.
Did you have a deadline?
Try to get some sleep.
If you hadn't procrastinated all semester, you wouldn't have had that problem.
Well, try to get to bed earlier tonight.
Do you need an energy drink?
Why were you working so late last night?
