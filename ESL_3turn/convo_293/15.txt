Oh, that's too bad.
Were you working on the big project for work?
Maybe you can head home early today.
Try to get some sleep.
If you hadn't procrastinated all semester, you wouldn't have had that problem.
Were you able to finish what you were doing?
You'll feel better as soon as you get some sleep.
I hope you feel better soon.
