Were you working on the big project for work?
Maybe you can head home early today.
Did you have a deadline?
Well, try to get to bed earlier tonight.
Were you able to finish what you were doing?
You'll feel better as soon as you get some sleep.
Here, have another cup of coffee.
I hope you feel better soon.
