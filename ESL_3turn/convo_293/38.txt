Were you working on the big project for work?
Did you have a deadline?
Try to get some sleep.
If you hadn't procrastinated all semester, you wouldn't have had that problem.
You'll feel better as soon as you get some sleep.
Here, have another cup of coffee.
I hope you feel better soon.
Hopefully you can catch up tonight.
