Oh, that's too bad.
Were you working on the big project for work?
Try to get some sleep.
If you hadn't procrastinated all semester, you wouldn't have had that problem.
Well, try to get to bed earlier tonight.
Here, have another cup of coffee.
I hope you feel better soon.
Why were you working so late last night?
