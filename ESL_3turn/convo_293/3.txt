Oh, that's too bad.
Were you working on the big project for work?
Did you have a deadline?
Try to get some sleep.
If you hadn't procrastinated all semester, you wouldn't have had that problem.
Here, have another cup of coffee.
Why were you working so late last night?
Hopefully you can catch up tonight.
