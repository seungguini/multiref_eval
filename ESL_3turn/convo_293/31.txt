Oh, that's too bad.
Were you working on the big project for work?
Did you have a deadline?
If you hadn't procrastinated all semester, you wouldn't have had that problem.
Well, try to get to bed earlier tonight.
Were you able to finish what you were doing?
Here, have another cup of coffee.
Hopefully you can catch up tonight.
