Oh, that's too bad.
Try to get some sleep.
If you hadn't procrastinated all semester, you wouldn't have had that problem.
Well, try to get to bed earlier tonight.
You'll feel better as soon as you get some sleep.
Here, have another cup of coffee.
I hope you feel better soon.
Do you need an energy drink?
