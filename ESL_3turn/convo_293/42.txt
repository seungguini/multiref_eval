Were you working on the big project for work?
Maybe you can head home early today.
If you hadn't procrastinated all semester, you wouldn't have had that problem.
Well, try to get to bed earlier tonight.
I hope you feel better soon.
Do you need an energy drink?
Why were you working so late last night?
Hopefully you can catch up tonight.
