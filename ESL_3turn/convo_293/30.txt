Oh, that's too bad.
Were you working on the big project for work?
If you hadn't procrastinated all semester, you wouldn't have had that problem.
Well, try to get to bed earlier tonight.
Were you able to finish what you were doing?
You'll feel better as soon as you get some sleep.
I hope you feel better soon.
Why were you working so late last night?
