I think so, I've been doing my research.
I'm going to vote in favor of them.
Yes. Have you?
I'm not sure yet, I've been reading up on the measures.

No, not yet.
I'm going to vote in favor of Measure 1 and 2, but against Measure 3.
I'm leaning towards voting in favor of them, but I'm still undecided.
