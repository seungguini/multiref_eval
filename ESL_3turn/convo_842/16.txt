I think so, I've been doing my research.
I have decided, but I'd rather not say how.
I'm going to vote in favor of them.
I'm going to vote against them.
No, not yet.
I'm going to vote in favor of Measure 1 and 2, but against Measure 3.
I haven't decided yet.
I'm leaning towards voting in favor of them, but I'm still undecided.
