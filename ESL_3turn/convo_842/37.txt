No, not yet.`
I think so, I've been doing my research.
I'm going to vote in favor of them.
I'm not sure yet, I've been reading up on the measures.
I'm going to vote against them.
I'm going to vote in favor of Measure 1 and 2, but against Measure 3.
I haven't decided yet.
I'm leaning towards voting in favor of them, but I'm still undecided.
