I have decided, but I'd rather not say how.
I'm going to vote in favor of them.
Yes. Have you?
I'm not sure yet, I've been reading up on the measures.
No, I have not decided.
I'm going to vote against them.
I'm going to vote in favor of Measure 1 and 2, but against Measure 3.
I haven't decided yet.
