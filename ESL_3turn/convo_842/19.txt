I think so, I've been doing my research.
I have decided, but I'd rather not say how.
Yes. Have you?
I'm not sure yet, I've been reading up on the measures.
No, I have not decided.
I'm going to vote against them.
I'm going to vote in favor of Measure 1 and 2, but against Measure 3.
I'm leaning towards voting in favor of them, but I'm still undecided.
