Is that all it takes to be good?
You have to be pretty intelligent to be able to pick it up.
You need to get out there and play to get better.
Can you teach me to be good at cards?
I hear that's the most important thing.
Have you learned a lot?
I'm not much into cards myself.
Is that effective for you?
