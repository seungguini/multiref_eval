Well it takes some time.
Maybe you should focus on yourself for a while.
Maybe you haven't found the right boy.
Having a boyfriend isn't a goal. Being with someone you love is. Love will just find you.
Maybe he's not the right one for you then.
I think you are coming off as desperate.
Give it time.  He might be shy.
One day, the right person will notice you.
