Well it takes some time.
Having a boyfriend isn't a goal. Being with someone you love is. Love will just find you.
Maybe he's not the right one for you then.
I think you are coming off as desperate.
You're trying too hard. Just relax.
You just have to relax and let things happen naturally.
One day, the right person will notice you.
You could try putting yourself out there more.
