Maybe you should focus on yourself for a while.
Maybe he's not the right one for you then.
I think you are coming off as desperate.
Give it time.  He might be shy.
You're trying too hard. Just relax.
You just have to relax and let things happen naturally.
One day, the right person will notice you.
You could try putting yourself out there more.
