Well it takes some time.
Maybe you should focus on yourself for a while.
Maybe you haven't found the right boy.
Having a boyfriend isn't a goal. Being with someone you love is. Love will just find you.
I think you are coming off as desperate.
Give it time.  He might be shy.
You're trying too hard. Just relax.
You just have to relax and let things happen naturally.
