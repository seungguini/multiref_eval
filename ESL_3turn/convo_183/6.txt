Maybe you should focus on yourself for a while.
Maybe you haven't found the right boy.
Maybe he's not the right one for you then.
I think you are coming off as desperate.
Give it time.  He might be shy.
You're trying too hard. Just relax.
You just have to relax and let things happen naturally.
You could try putting yourself out there more.
