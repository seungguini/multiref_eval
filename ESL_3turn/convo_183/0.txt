Well it takes some time.
Maybe you should focus on yourself for a while.
Maybe you haven't found the right boy.
Maybe he's not the right one for you then.
I think you are coming off as desperate.
Give it time.  He might be shy.
You just have to relax and let things happen naturally.
One day, the right person will notice you.
