Well it takes some time.
Maybe you should focus on yourself for a while.
Maybe you haven't found the right boy.
Having a boyfriend isn't a goal. Being with someone you love is. Love will just find you.
I think you are coming off as desperate.
You just have to relax and let things happen naturally.
One day, the right person will notice you.
You could try putting yourself out there more.
