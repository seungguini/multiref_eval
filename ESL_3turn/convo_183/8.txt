Well it takes some time.
Maybe you haven't found the right boy.
Maybe he's not the right one for you then.
Give it time.  He might be shy.
You're trying too hard. Just relax.
You just have to relax and let things happen naturally.
One day, the right person will notice you.
You could try putting yourself out there more.
