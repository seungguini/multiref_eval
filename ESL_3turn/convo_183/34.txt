Well it takes some time.
Maybe you haven't found the right boy.
Having a boyfriend isn't a goal. Being with someone you love is. Love will just find you.
Maybe he's not the right one for you then.
I think you are coming off as desperate.
You just have to relax and let things happen naturally.
One day, the right person will notice you.
You could try putting yourself out there more.
