Well it takes some time.
Maybe you should focus on yourself for a while.
Maybe you haven't found the right boy.
I think you are coming off as desperate.
Give it time.  He might be shy.
You're trying too hard. Just relax.
One day, the right person will notice you.
You could try putting yourself out there more.
