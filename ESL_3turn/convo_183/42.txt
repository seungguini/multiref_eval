Well it takes some time.
Maybe you should focus on yourself for a while.
Maybe you haven't found the right boy.
Give it time.  He might be shy.
You're trying too hard. Just relax.
You just have to relax and let things happen naturally.
One day, the right person will notice you.
You could try putting yourself out there more.
