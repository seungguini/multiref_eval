I would like to discuss the last grade I received.
I had a hard time picking up the last step.
I have a wedding to go to, so I won't be able to make it.
I'm having problems with my thesis project.
Ah, nothing. Nevermind it.
Can you explain what we went over today again?
I was wondering if you could look at my research paper and let me know if I'm in the right direction.
I have explosive diarrhea!
