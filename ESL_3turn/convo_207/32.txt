I would like to discuss the last grade I received.
I need to talk to you about my grade.
I had a hard time picking up the last step.
I have a wedding to go to, so I won't be able to make it.
I'm having problems with my thesis project.
Ah, nothing. Nevermind it.
Can you explain what we went over today again?
I have explosive diarrhea!
