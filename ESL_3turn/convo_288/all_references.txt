It is so beautiful outside.
I'm so tired I might fall asleep halfway through.
I am too tired to stay awak.
I have a headache.
There must be something we can do outside instead.
Movies are too expensive these days.
My stomach is hurting.
I don't like movies.
Its too expensive these days.
It's always too cold in the theater.
You might try to kiss me!
I'd rather stay home.
I am bored with this date.
I have too much work to do.
