You know I don't like blind dates.
No I would never with you.
I'm not interested.
With someone you know?
If you knew me well you wouldn't ask such a silly question.
I am busy for the next few years.
I suppose I could give it a try.
Is he a creep?
That's okay.  I doing good on my own.
Not really interested.
I am up for an adventure.
Is the guy good looking?
