It's not safe for those motorcyclists either.
Especially when it's also pouring rain.
I hope everyone is safe on this night.

It's dangerous for us, too. Let's just wait.
I know! My RV sways wildly in this sort of wind.
I've never seen it this windy before. Is there a hurricane coming?
Sharon has a hard time with this wind driving the school bus.
