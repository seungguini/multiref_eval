I agree, a semi could blow into the other lane.
It's not safe for those motorcyclists either.
Especially when it's also pouring rain.
Driving a large van in this wind makes me nervous.
I hope everyone is safe on this night.
It's dangerous for us, too. Let's just wait.
I know! My RV sways wildly in this sort of wind.
Sharon has a hard time with this wind driving the school bus.
