I agree, a semi could blow into the other lane.
Especially when it's also pouring rain.
I think we just need to wait and see if it calms down.

It's dangerous for us, too. Let's just wait.
I've never seen it this windy before. Is there a hurricane coming?
Sharon has a hard time with this wind driving the school bus.
