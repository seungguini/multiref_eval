I agree, a semi could blow into the other lane.
It's not safe for those motorcyclists either.
Especially when it's also pouring rain.
I think we just need to wait and see if it calms down.
I hope everyone is safe on this night.
I wonder what is on all those papers in the air.
I've never seen it this windy before. Is there a hurricane coming?
Sharon has a hard time with this wind driving the school bus.
