I agree, a semi could blow into the other lane.
It's not safe for those motorcyclists either.
Especially when it's also pouring rain.
I think we just need to wait and see if it calms down.
Driving a large van in this wind makes me nervous.
It's dangerous for us, too. Let's just wait.
I know! My RV sways wildly in this sort of wind.
I wonder what is on all those papers in the air.
