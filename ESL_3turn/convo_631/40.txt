It's not safe for those motorcyclists either.
Especially when it's also pouring rain.
I think we just need to wait and see if it calms down.
Driving a large van in this wind makes me nervous.
I hope everyone is safe on this night.
Luckily, my job requires me to be indoors.
I wonder what is on all those papers in the air.
I've never seen it this windy before. Is there a hurricane coming?
