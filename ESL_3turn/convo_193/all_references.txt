I still have homework to do.
I'm waiting for the baseball game to end.
I'm going to right now.
I need to do homework.
I have to catch up on this paperwork.
I don't have to get up tomorrow, so I want to stay up awhile.
I'm too tired to sleep.
I want to watch something.
I wanted to see what was happening on the news.
That's a good idea.
I was waiting to hear about the plane crash on the news.
I need to eat something first.
I don't think I can sleep. I'm too worked up.
Should I?
