Can you please elaborate?
Yes, I remember when you were first hired.
And you've done a great job!
So are you thinking of leaving us?
I know. Is there something wrong?
You're not thinking of leaving us, are you?
How many more years do you plan on putting in?
Seems like you can teach me a lot about this place.
