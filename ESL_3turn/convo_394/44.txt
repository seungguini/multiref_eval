Can you please elaborate?
Yes, I remember when you were first hired.
And why are you telling me that?
Are you thining of retiring soon or something?
I know. Is there something wrong?
That is good, do you still like it here?
You're not thinking of leaving us, are you?
How many more years do you plan on putting in?
