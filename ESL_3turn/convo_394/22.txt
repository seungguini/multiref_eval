Yes, I know.
Yes, I remember when you were first hired.
And why are you telling me that?
And you've done a great job!
That is good, do you still like it here?
You're not thinking of leaving us, are you?
How many more years do you plan on putting in?
Seems like you can teach me a lot about this place.
