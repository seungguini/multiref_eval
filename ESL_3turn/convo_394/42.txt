Can you please elaborate?
Yes, I remember when you were first hired.
And you want a raise?
Are you thining of retiring soon or something?
So are you thinking of leaving us?
That is good, do you still like it here?
You're not thinking of leaving us, are you?
How many more years do you plan on putting in?
