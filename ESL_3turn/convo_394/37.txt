Can you please elaborate?
Okay, so what can I do for you?
And you've done a great job!
I know. Is there something wrong?
You're not thinking of leaving us, are you?
How many more years do you plan on putting in?
I hope you stay with us another 10 years.
Seems like you can teach me a lot about this place.
