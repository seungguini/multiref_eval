And why are you telling me that?
Okay, so what can I do for you?
And you want a raise?
Are you thining of retiring soon or something?
I know. Is there something wrong?
You're not thinking of leaving us, are you?
How many more years do you plan on putting in?
I hope you stay with us another 10 years.
