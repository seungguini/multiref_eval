Try googling public transportation near me.
You have a few options.  You can take the bus, metro, or train.
Some people prefer taxi cabs if they don't like crowds.
I could still point you in the right direction.
You can check online, the schedule changes depending on the day of the week
You can call them to find out.
It has been so long and I'm not sure if I can help.
There is an information booth at the bus station.
