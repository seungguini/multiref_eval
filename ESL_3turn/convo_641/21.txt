Well the most frequently used is the city busline that goes all around the city.
Try googling public transportation near me.
The public transportation department offers that information on their website
You have a few options.  You can take the bus, metro, or train.
Some people prefer taxi cabs if they don't like crowds.
You can check online, the schedule changes depending on the day of the week
Maybe I can still help. What do you want to know?
There is an information booth at the bus station.
