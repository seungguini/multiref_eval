Traffic is terrible.
I hate traffic.
We can join the cycling club at school.
There's a bunch of used bikes listed for sale at the Student Center.
It would be so good for the environment.
You could save a lot of money on gas, too.
We can go cycling together on the weekends.
What would you do if it rained?
