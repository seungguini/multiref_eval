Traffic is terrible.
Have you looked at any of the new models yet?
I hate traffic.
We can join the cycling club at school.
There's a bunch of used bikes listed for sale at the Student Center.
You could save a lot of money on gas, too.
What would you do if it rained?
How long would it take you to get to work on a bike?
