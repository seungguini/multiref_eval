I am 25 years old and a mother of two kids.
I'm an honest, hard working employee, I love being in customer service, and I'm always happy to help even the most difficult customer.
I am passionate about animals!
I've been a certified RN for 5 years now.
I really need this job, my family has been homeless for over a year, I promise you, I'll work harder than most.
I am a good people person and a quick thinker!
I have experience working with disabled children.
My younger sister has autism. She has inspired me.
