I think the seat folds up to make room for the chair.
He will fold the seat up so that the wheelchair can fit in its place.
They should have a special seat for them.
He will put some of the seats up so the wheelchair fits.
I'm not sure.
He's going to push them back so there's room.
Just watch. You'll see.
I'm curious to see as well.
