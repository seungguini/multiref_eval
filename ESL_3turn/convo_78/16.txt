I think the seat folds up to make room for the chair.
He will fold the seat up so that the wheelchair can fit in its place.
He will put some of the seats up so the wheelchair fits.
I don't actually know. I've never seen it done before.
I'm not sure.
They're giving him a comfortable seat.
He's going to push them back so there's room.
I'm curious to see as well.
