I think the seat folds up to make room for the chair.
They should have a special seat for them.
He will put some of the seats up so the wheelchair fits.
I don't actually know. I've never seen it done before.
They're giving him a comfortable seat.
He's going to push them back so there's room.
Just watch. You'll see.
I'm curious to see as well.
