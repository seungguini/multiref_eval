I think the seat folds up to make room for the chair.
He will fold the seat up so that the wheelchair can fit in its place.
They should have a special seat for them.
I don't actually know. I've never seen it done before.
I'm not sure.
They're giving him a comfortable seat.
He's going to push them back so there's room.
I'm curious to see as well.
