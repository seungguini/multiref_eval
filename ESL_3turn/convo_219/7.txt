yeah.  just my luck.  it's gotten stuck twice this week.
Sometimes they sure do.
I just want my snack.
I really like those chips.
This one definitely does.
Last week I got a free bag out of this machine, so I guess I'm even now.
I usually don't have a problem.
Are you getting chips? Maybe your's will push mine out.
