I always lose money.
Everything always gets stuck.
yeah.  just my luck.  it's gotten stuck twice this week.
I really like those chips.
I've already lost two bucks in this machine.
Maybe next time I'll try another one.
Last week I got a free bag out of this machine, so I guess I'm even now.
I'm about to break it open.
