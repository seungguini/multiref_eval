Everything always gets stuck.
yeah.  just my luck.  it's gotten stuck twice this week.
This always happens to me.
I've already lost two bucks in this machine.
This one definitely does.
Maybe next time I'll try another one.
I usually don't have a problem.
Are you getting chips? Maybe your's will push mine out.
