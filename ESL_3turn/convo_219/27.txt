yeah.  just my luck.  it's gotten stuck twice this week.
This always happens to me.
Sometimes they sure do.
This one definitely does.
Last week I got a free bag out of this machine, so I guess I'm even now.
I usually don't have a problem.
Are you getting chips? Maybe your's will push mine out.
Yeah. I think I'm just going to give up.
