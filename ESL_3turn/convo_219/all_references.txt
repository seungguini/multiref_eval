I always lose money.
Everything always gets stuck.
yeah.  just my luck.  it's gotten stuck twice this week.
This always happens to me.
Sometimes they sure do.
I just want my snack.
I really like those chips.
I've already lost two bucks in this machine.
This one definitely does.
Maybe next time I'll try another one.
Last week I got a free bag out of this machine, so I guess I'm even now.
I usually don't have a problem.
I'm about to break it open.
Are you getting chips? Maybe your's will push mine out.
Last time I had to kick a few times.
Yeah. I think I'm just going to give up.
