Everything always gets stuck.
This always happens to me.
This one definitely does.
Maybe next time I'll try another one.
Last week I got a free bag out of this machine, so I guess I'm even now.
I usually don't have a problem.
Are you getting chips? Maybe your's will push mine out.
Last time I had to kick a few times.
