I always lose money.
This always happens to me.
I really like those chips.
I've already lost two bucks in this machine.
This one definitely does.
Last week I got a free bag out of this machine, so I guess I'm even now.
Are you getting chips? Maybe your's will push mine out.
Yeah. I think I'm just going to give up.
