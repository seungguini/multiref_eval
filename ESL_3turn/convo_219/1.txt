yeah.  just my luck.  it's gotten stuck twice this week.
This always happens to me.
I just want my snack.
I've already lost two bucks in this machine.
Maybe next time I'll try another one.
I usually don't have a problem.
Are you getting chips? Maybe your's will push mine out.
Last time I had to kick a few times.
