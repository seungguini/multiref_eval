I always lose money.
yeah.  just my luck.  it's gotten stuck twice this week.
This always happens to me.
I've already lost two bucks in this machine.
Last week I got a free bag out of this machine, so I guess I'm even now.
I usually don't have a problem.
Last time I had to kick a few times.
Yeah. I think I'm just going to give up.
