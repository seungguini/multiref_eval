I always lose money.
Everything always gets stuck.
yeah.  just my luck.  it's gotten stuck twice this week.
This always happens to me.
Sometimes they sure do.
I've already lost two bucks in this machine.
Last week I got a free bag out of this machine, so I guess I'm even now.
Yeah. I think I'm just going to give up.
