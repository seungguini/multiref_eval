I seriously judge people who didn't.
It went by so fast.
I'm glad he won
He's done such a great job.
He was an amazing president.
I'm not sure how I feel about his presidency once Trump took office.
I feel like most people I know did
He's a much better president than Trump.
What were the main things you liked about him?
I don't really like to get into politics.
I knew we shared some of the same values.
There's no winning politics.
Oh cool!
Politics is such a touchy topic.
