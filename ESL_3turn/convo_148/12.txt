Because of the "sour"?
Have you ever tried it before?
Why does it sound gross?
Where are you from that you don't know what sour cream is?
You'll never know unless you try it.
It actually tastes really good with this kind of food.
That's a little rude.
You might like it! Just try a little bit of it.
