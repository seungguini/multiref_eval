Because of the "sour"?
It's not that bad!
Have you ever tried it before?
It's good.
Why does it sound gross?
I've seen you eat much worse.
It's not as bad as the name makes it sound.
You don't know what you're missing.
Where are you from that you don't know what sour cream is?
You'll never know unless you try it.
It actually tastes really good with this kind of food.
It's delicious.
That's a little rude.
Come on, just try a little!
You might like it! Just try a little bit of it.
