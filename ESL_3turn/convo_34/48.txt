What's wrong with them?
No, what did the waiter have on his hands?
Wasn't he wearing gloves?
No but you are being crazy!
Did the waiter have something threatening in his hands?
Maybe we can just switch to a different section with a different waiter.
I don't understand why you have a problem with the waiter's hands?
I did, but I didn't see anything that was threatening.
