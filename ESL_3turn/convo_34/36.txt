No but you are being crazy!
What were in the waiter's hands?
His hands were fine!
Did the waiter have something threatening in his hands?
I don't understand why you have a problem with the waiter's hands?
I did, but I didn't see anything that was threatening.
You are just trying to find a reason not to eat here!
Yeah, but why does that make you want to leave?
