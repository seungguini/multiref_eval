Wasn't he wearing gloves?
Yes, but I don't think that it's contagious.
No but you are being crazy!
His hands were fine!
Maybe we can just switch to a different section with a different waiter.
I don't understand why you have a problem with the waiter's hands?
I did, but I didn't see anything that was threatening.
You are just trying to find a reason not to eat here!
