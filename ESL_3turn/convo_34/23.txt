What's wrong with them?
No, what did the waiter have on his hands?
No but you are being crazy!
His hands were fine!
Did the waiter have something threatening in his hands?
I don't understand why you have a problem with the waiter's hands?
You are just trying to find a reason not to eat here!
Yeah, but why does that make you want to leave?
