What's wrong with them?
No but you are being crazy!
What were in the waiter's hands?
Were they dirty or something?
Maybe we can just switch to a different section with a different waiter.
I don't understand why you have a problem with the waiter's hands?
I did, but I didn't see anything that was threatening.
You are just trying to find a reason not to eat here!
