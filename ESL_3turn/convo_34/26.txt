What's wrong with them?
No, what did the waiter have on his hands?
Wasn't he wearing gloves?
Yes, but I don't think that it's contagious.
Were they dirty or something?
His hands were fine!
Did the waiter have something threatening in his hands?
I did, but I didn't see anything that was threatening.
