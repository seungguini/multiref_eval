What's wrong with them?
No, what did the waiter have on his hands?
No but you are being crazy!
Were they dirty or something?
Maybe we can just switch to a different section with a different waiter.
I did, but I didn't see anything that was threatening.
You are just trying to find a reason not to eat here!
Yeah, but why does that make you want to leave?
