What's wrong with them?
No but you are being crazy!
What were in the waiter's hands?
Were they dirty or something?
His hands were fine!
Maybe we can just switch to a different section with a different waiter.
You are just trying to find a reason not to eat here!
Yeah, but why does that make you want to leave?
