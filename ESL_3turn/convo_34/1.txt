No, what did the waiter have on his hands?
Yes, but I don't think that it's contagious.
What were in the waiter's hands?
His hands were fine!
Maybe we can just switch to a different section with a different waiter.
I did, but I didn't see anything that was threatening.
You are just trying to find a reason not to eat here!
