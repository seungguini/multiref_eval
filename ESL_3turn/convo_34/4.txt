What's wrong with them?
No, what did the waiter have on his hands?
No but you are being crazy!
What were in the waiter's hands?
His hands were fine!
Maybe we can just switch to a different section with a different waiter.
I did, but I didn't see anything that was threatening.
You are just trying to find a reason not to eat here!
