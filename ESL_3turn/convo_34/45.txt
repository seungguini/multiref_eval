No, what is wrong with them?
No, what did the waiter have on his hands?
Were they dirty or something?
His hands were fine!
Did the waiter have something threatening in his hands?
Maybe we can just switch to a different section with a different waiter.
I don't understand why you have a problem with the waiter's hands?
You are just trying to find a reason not to eat here!
