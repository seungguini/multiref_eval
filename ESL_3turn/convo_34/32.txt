What's wrong with them?
No, what did the waiter have on his hands?
Wasn't he wearing gloves?
No but you are being crazy!
Were they dirty or something?
Maybe we can just switch to a different section with a different waiter.
I don't understand why you have a problem with the waiter's hands?
You are just trying to find a reason not to eat here!
