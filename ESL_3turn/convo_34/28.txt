No, what is wrong with them?
Wasn't he wearing gloves?
What were in the waiter's hands?
His hands were fine!
Maybe we can just switch to a different section with a different waiter.
I don't understand why you have a problem with the waiter's hands?
You are just trying to find a reason not to eat here!
Yeah, but why does that make you want to leave?
