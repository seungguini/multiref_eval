What's wrong with them?
No, what did the waiter have on his hands?
Yes, but I don't think that it's contagious.
No but you are being crazy!
Maybe we can just switch to a different section with a different waiter.
I don't understand why you have a problem with the waiter's hands?
You are just trying to find a reason not to eat here!
Yeah, but why does that make you want to leave?
