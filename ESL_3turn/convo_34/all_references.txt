No, what is wrong with them?
What's wrong with them?
No, what did the waiter have on his hands?
Wasn't he wearing gloves?
Yes, but I don't think that it's contagious.
No but you are being crazy!
What were in the waiter's hands?
Were they dirty or something?
His hands were fine!
Did the waiter have something threatening in his hands?
Maybe we can just switch to a different section with a different waiter.
I don't understand why you have a problem with the waiter's hands?
I did, but I didn't see anything that was threatening.
You are just trying to find a reason not to eat here!
Yeah, but why does that make you want to leave?
