No, what did the waiter have on his hands?
Wasn't he wearing gloves?
No but you are being crazy!
What were in the waiter's hands?
Maybe we can just switch to a different section with a different waiter.
I don't understand why you have a problem with the waiter's hands?
I did, but I didn't see anything that was threatening.
Yeah, but why does that make you want to leave?
