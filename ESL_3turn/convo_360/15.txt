Luckily it didn't now please cheer up!
Then everything really would be going wrong today.
I'm sorry things are going wrong, hopefully the weather is putting you in a better mood.
I don't want to imagine that.
Exactly. It's not all bad.
Yes we got lucky.
Don't jinx it.
I think it's getting cloudy now.
