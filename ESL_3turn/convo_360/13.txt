Then everything really would be going wrong today.
I'm sorry things are going wrong, hopefully the weather is putting you in a better mood.
I don't want to imagine that.
It still might.
That would be awful!
See? Think positive!
I think it's getting cloudy now.
The plants would at least get some water!
