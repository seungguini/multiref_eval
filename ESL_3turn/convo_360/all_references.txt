Luckily it didn't now please cheer up!
We would have been really screwed.
That would have been terrible.
Then everything really would be going wrong today.
I'm sorry things are going wrong, hopefully the weather is putting you in a better mood.
I don't want to imagine that.
It still might.
Exactly. It's not all bad.
Yes we got lucky.
That would be awful!
Don't jinx it.
See? Think positive!
I think it's getting cloudy now.
The plants would at least get some water!
