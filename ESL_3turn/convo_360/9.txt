We would have been really screwed.
That would have been terrible.
Then everything really would be going wrong today.
I'm sorry things are going wrong, hopefully the weather is putting you in a better mood.
I don't want to imagine that.
Yes we got lucky.
I think it's getting cloudy now.
The plants would at least get some water!
