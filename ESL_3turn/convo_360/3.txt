Luckily it didn't now please cheer up!
That would have been terrible.
Then everything really would be going wrong today.
I'm sorry things are going wrong, hopefully the weather is putting you in a better mood.
Yes we got lucky.
That would be awful!
See? Think positive!
I think it's getting cloudy now.
