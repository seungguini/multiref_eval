Luckily it didn't now please cheer up!
That would have been terrible.
I'm sorry things are going wrong, hopefully the weather is putting you in a better mood.
Exactly. It's not all bad.
That would be awful!
See? Think positive!
I think it's getting cloudy now.
The plants would at least get some water!
