Luckily it didn't now please cheer up!
That would have been terrible.
Then everything really would be going wrong today.
I'm sorry things are going wrong, hopefully the weather is putting you in a better mood.
Exactly. It's not all bad.
Yes we got lucky.
Don't jinx it.
The plants would at least get some water!
