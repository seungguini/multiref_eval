It is kind of weird but I like her.
But I'm really nervous.
While that does sort of gross me out, I can get past it.
I don't usually think about that.
Fortunately I don't tend to get jealous or anything, so that doesn't really bother me.
She hasn't dated that many people.
Oh god, you're right. I don't think I can stand dating someone who dated DAVE!
I suppose that's true.
