That doesn't bother me as much as you interrogating me about it.
But I'm really nervous.
It's good that I know who she dated because I know what she doesn't like in a guy.
While that does sort of gross me out, I can get past it.
I don't usually think about that.
She hasn't dated that many people.
Oh god, you're right. I don't think I can stand dating someone who dated DAVE!
I never thought about that.
