It is kind of weird but I like her.
That doesn't bother me as much as you interrogating me about it.
I don't care about that.
While that does sort of gross me out, I can get past it.
I don't usually think about that.
Fortunately I don't tend to get jealous or anything, so that doesn't really bother me.
I suppose that's true.
I never thought about that.
