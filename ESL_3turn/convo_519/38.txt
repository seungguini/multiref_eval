But I'm really nervous.
It's good that I know who she dated because I know what she doesn't like in a guy.
While that does sort of gross me out, I can get past it.
Okay, maybe I should give it a try.
Fortunately I don't tend to get jealous or anything, so that doesn't really bother me.
Oh god, you're right. I don't think I can stand dating someone who dated DAVE!
I suppose that's true.
I never thought about that.
