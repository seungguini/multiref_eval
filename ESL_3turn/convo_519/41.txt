It is kind of weird but I like her.
That doesn't bother me as much as you interrogating me about it.
Okay, maybe I should give it a try.
I don't usually think about that.
Fortunately I don't tend to get jealous or anything, so that doesn't really bother me.
Oh god, you're right. I don't think I can stand dating someone who dated DAVE!
I suppose that's true.
I never thought about that.
