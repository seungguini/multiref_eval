It is kind of weird but I like her.
That doesn't bother me as much as you interrogating me about it.
But I'm really nervous.
I don't care about that.
It's good that I know who she dated because I know what she doesn't like in a guy.
Okay, maybe I should give it a try.
She hasn't dated that many people.
I suppose that's true.
