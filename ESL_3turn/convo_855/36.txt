Yes, they all have locks.
They do, but only the front has a key.
There are deadbolts on both doors.
Is there an alarm system?
Yes, and the front has two locks - your apartment lock and an exterior building lock.
Only the front door needs a passcode.
I'm not sure, to be honest.
How safe is this neighborhood?
