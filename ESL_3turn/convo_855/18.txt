S BOTH DOOR EQUIP WITH LOCKS
Yes, they all have locks.
There are deadbolts on both doors.
Is there an alarm system?
Yes, and the front has two locks - your apartment lock and an exterior building lock.
Only the front door needs a passcode.
Are there cameras on the premise?
I'm not sure, to be honest.
