I don't blame you.  I was scared too when I first got my license.
You're being ridiculous.
There are a lot of crazy drivers on the road.
I understand; I'm a very nervous but cautious new driver.
You don't really have another option.
Good luck driving.
I hope you're joking or I'm going to feel insulted.
Do you seriously doubt my abilities?
