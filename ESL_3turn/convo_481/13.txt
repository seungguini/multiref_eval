I don't blame you.  I was scared too when I first got my license.
You're being ridiculous.
I passed both the written and behind-the-wheel exams with flying colors!
There are a lot of crazy drivers on the road.
Don't worry I'm being very careful.
You don't really have another option.
Good luck driving.
I hope you're joking or I'm going to feel insulted.
