I don't blame you.  I was scared too when I first got my license.
I passed both the written and behind-the-wheel exams with flying colors!
There are a lot of crazy drivers on the road.
You don't really have another option.
Good luck driving.
I don't blame you, I don't know what I'm doing.
I hope you're joking or I'm going to feel insulted.
Do you seriously doubt my abilities?
