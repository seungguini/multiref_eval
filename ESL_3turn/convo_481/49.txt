I don't blame you.  I was scared too when I first got my license.
You're being ridiculous.
I passed both the written and behind-the-wheel exams with flying colors!
Don't worry. I've been practicing.
There are a lot of crazy drivers on the road.
Don't worry I'm being very careful.
Good luck driving.
Do you seriously doubt my abilities?
