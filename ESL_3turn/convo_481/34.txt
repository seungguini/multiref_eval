I don't blame you.  I was scared too when I first got my license.
You're being ridiculous.
Don't worry. I've been practicing.
I understand; I'm a very nervous but cautious new driver.
You don't really have another option.
Good luck driving.
I don't blame you, I don't know what I'm doing.
I hope you're joking or I'm going to feel insulted.
