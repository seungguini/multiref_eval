Or maybe they forgot about us.
I think they are just slow.
Maybe so, but it doesn't usually get busy there at this time.
I'm getting annoyed.
I wonder why they are so busy.
Should we talk to the manager?
I'm getting so hungry I feel like I'm going to faint.
I don't see anyone else waiting for food.
