Do you think they forgot to put the order in?
Maybe so, but it doesn't usually get busy there at this time.
Maybe we should just leave.
I wonder why they are so busy.
Should we talk to the manager?
Is their service always this slow?
I don't see anyone else waiting for food.
It's getting kind of ridiculous.
