Or maybe they forgot about us.
Do you think they forgot to put the order in?
Maybe so, but it doesn't usually get busy there at this time.
Maybe we should just leave.
I wonder why they are so busy.
I'm starving, I hope it comes soon.
I'm getting so hungry I feel like I'm going to faint.
It's getting kind of ridiculous.
