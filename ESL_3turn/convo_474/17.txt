Or maybe they forgot about us.
Do you think they forgot to put the order in?
Maybe so, but it doesn't usually get busy there at this time.
I'm getting annoyed.
I don't know what could be taking so long.
Is their service always this slow?
I'm getting so hungry I feel like I'm going to faint.
I don't see anyone else waiting for food.
