Or maybe they forgot about us.
Do you think they forgot to put the order in?
Maybe so, but it doesn't usually get busy there at this time.
Maybe we should just leave.
Should we talk to the manager?
I don't know what could be taking so long.
I'm getting so hungry I feel like I'm going to faint.
It's getting kind of ridiculous.
