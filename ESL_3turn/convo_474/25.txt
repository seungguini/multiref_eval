Or maybe they forgot about us.
Do you think they forgot to put the order in?
Maybe so, but it doesn't usually get busy there at this time.
I'm starving, I hope it comes soon.
Should we talk to the manager?
I don't know what could be taking so long.
Is their service always this slow?
It's getting kind of ridiculous.
