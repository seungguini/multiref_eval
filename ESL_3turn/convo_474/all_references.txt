Or maybe they forgot about us.
Do you think they forgot to put the order in?
I think they are just slow.
Maybe so, but it doesn't usually get busy there at this time.
Maybe we should just leave.
I hope our food isn't cold.
I'm getting annoyed.
I wonder why they are so busy.
I'm starving, I hope it comes soon.
Should we talk to the manager?
I don't know what could be taking so long.
Is their service always this slow?
I'm getting so hungry I feel like I'm going to faint.
I don't see anyone else waiting for food.
It's getting kind of ridiculous.
