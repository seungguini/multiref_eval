Or maybe they forgot about us.
Maybe so, but it doesn't usually get busy there at this time.
I hope our food isn't cold.
I'm starving, I hope it comes soon.
Should we talk to the manager?
Is their service always this slow?
I'm getting so hungry I feel like I'm going to faint.
I don't see anyone else waiting for food.
