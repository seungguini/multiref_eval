Why don't you cook dinner you smartass.
I still have to get work done from home.
Yes it does! I'm exhausted.
Why don't we just go out
I make more than you working at home how doesn't that count?
You think just because you have a job sitting in a chair for hours at an office, that's so much different?
I am not your personal chef
How about no
