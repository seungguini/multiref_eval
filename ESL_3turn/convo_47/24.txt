It is a lot of work.
Do you want me to teach you how to do it?
Here, I'll teach you.
I do it all the time and am glad to help you!
I bet we could look it up on the internet and figure it out.
It would be way cheaper to do it yourself.
We can try to figure it out together if you want.
Yeah I'm not sure how to change the oil in my car by myself either.
