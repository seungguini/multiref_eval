It is a lot of work.
It would be cheaper if you'd learn.
Do you want me to teach you how to do it?
It's really easy to do!
It's not too bad once you know how to do it.
Here, I'll teach you.
There's lot of information online and it's easy to learn.
I do it all the time and am glad to help you!
I can teach you, if you want.
I bet we could look it up on the internet and figure it out.
I can ask my brother to teach you.
It would be way cheaper to do it yourself.
We can try to figure it out together if you want.
Yeah I'm not sure how to change the oil in my car by myself either.
