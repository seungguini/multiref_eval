It is a lot of work.
Do you want me to teach you how to do it?
It's really easy to do!
It's not too bad once you know how to do it.
I do it all the time and am glad to help you!
I bet we could look it up on the internet and figure it out.
It would be way cheaper to do it yourself.
Yeah I'm not sure how to change the oil in my car by myself either.
