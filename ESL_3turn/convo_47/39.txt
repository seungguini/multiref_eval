It is a lot of work.
It would be cheaper if you'd learn.
Do you want me to teach you how to do it?
It's really easy to do!
There's lot of information online and it's easy to learn.
I can ask my brother to teach you.
We can try to figure it out together if you want.
Yeah I'm not sure how to change the oil in my car by myself either.
