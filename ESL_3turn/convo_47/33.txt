It is a lot of work.
Do you want me to teach you how to do it?
It's really easy to do!
It's not too bad once you know how to do it.
There's lot of information online and it's easy to learn.
I can teach you, if you want.
We can try to figure it out together if you want.
Yeah I'm not sure how to change the oil in my car by myself either.
