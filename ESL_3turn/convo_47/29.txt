It's really easy to do!
It's not too bad once you know how to do it.
I do it all the time and am glad to help you!
I can teach you, if you want.
I can ask my brother to teach you.
It would be way cheaper to do it yourself.
We can try to figure it out together if you want.
Yeah I'm not sure how to change the oil in my car by myself either.
