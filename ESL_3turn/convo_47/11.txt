It is a lot of work.
Here, I'll teach you.
There's lot of information online and it's easy to learn.
I do it all the time and am glad to help you!
I bet we could look it up on the internet and figure it out.
I can ask my brother to teach you.
It would be way cheaper to do it yourself.
Yeah I'm not sure how to change the oil in my car by myself either.
