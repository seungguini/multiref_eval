Only if you go to pick it up.
Nah, I had that for lunch.
Thanks. I love pizza.
What kind of pizza should we get?
I am always down for pizza.
Sounds good, from where?
Ok. What toppings should we get on it?
How about cheese pizza?
Where do you want to order from?
I think I'd prefer Chinese Food.
What a great idea!
Can we get breadsticks too?
Should we get a pepperoni pizza?
What do you want on it?
