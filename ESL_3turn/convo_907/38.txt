The boss yelled at me in front of everyone.
I fell in front of the entire department.
I feel like I will never fit in there and I'm over my head.
I screwed up something that they didn't even tell me about.
My boss is mean, I hate it already.
I made tons of mistakes.
I hate my boss.
A customer yelled at me.
