Puppies are expensive.
A puppy is a big responsibility.
Whether we can afford it?
A puppy can be very expensive, I'll have to see if we have the money for one.
Whether you will take care of it.
I don't think you are responsible enough.
I need to come up with the money for it.
Who's gonna take care of it?
