Whether we can afford it?
Because a puppy is a lot of work.
A puppy is a huge responsibility.
A puppy can be very expensive, I'll have to see if we have the money for one.
Whether you will take care of it.
I don't think you are responsible enough.
I need to come up with the money for it.
Who's gonna take care of it?
