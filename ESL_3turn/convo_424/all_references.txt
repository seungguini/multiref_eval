So what happened?
She has to figure it out for herself.
He's sleeping with the neighbor.
You have to just leave it alone.
Did he harm her?
She has to make her own mistakes.
He stole her money.
It's really none of your business.
He crashed her car.
Just let her be happy.
He broke the front door when he was drunk.
You shouldn't be involved.
He's on heroin.
I know you mean best.
