Is that something you've always wanted to do?
Hawaii is beautiful this time of year.
Seems like there are more exciting cruises.
I've always wanted to cruise to Alaska.
Is a Hawaiian cruise very expensive?
I want to go too.
Make sure to pick the right time of year.
I would be a nervous wreck stuck on a boat like that.
