Geez. Sorry. Did it really affect you that much?
Sorry!
Sorry, I should have muted the phone first.
It tickled so bad I didn't have time to wait.
Sorry. I should've moved.
No. I didn't mean to.
My bad, was it that loud?
I didn't realize you would find it offensive.
It just happens!
Well, sorry.
I'm so embarrassed.
