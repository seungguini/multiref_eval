You should probably just wait then.
Can you call an Uber to take you there?
You should wait for the next bus.
Oh, that's not far away at all.
I see a taxi across the street. Why don't you flag it down?
Will that make you late?
I'll just drive you home.
You'll be all right then.
Why don't you catch a cab?
Do you need a ride to work?
Better get to walking!
That was a different bus.
