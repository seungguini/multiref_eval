I know where it is, I can help you find it.
If you go 2 blocks down that way, you'll see the bus stop.
I don't know how to get there.
I'm very sorry but I'm not familiar with the bus stops in this area.
I can drive you if you want.
Take the red line.
I'm going that way, just follow me.
I'm not sure, you should ask someone else.
