I know where it is, I can help you find it.
If you go 2 blocks down that way, you'll see the bus stop.
It's close by.
I can drive you if you want.
Take the red line.
Sorry, I'm unfamiliar with the local public transportation
I don't know where it is, but I'll help you find it.
I'm going that way, just follow me.
