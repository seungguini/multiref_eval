I know where it is, I can help you find it.
If you go 2 blocks down that way, you'll see the bus stop.
I don't know how to get there.
I'm very sorry but I'm not familiar with the bus stops in this area.
Take the red line.
Sorry, I'm unfamiliar with the local public transportation
I'm going that way, just follow me.
I'm not sure, you should ask someone else.
