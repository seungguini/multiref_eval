If you go 2 blocks down that way, you'll see the bus stop.
I don't know how to get there.
It's close by.
I'm very sorry but I'm not familiar with the bus stops in this area.
I can drive you if you want.
Sorry, I'm unfamiliar with the local public transportation
I don't know where it is, but I'll help you find it.
I'm not sure, you should ask someone else.
