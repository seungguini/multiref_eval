I can't find the bathroom. Do you know where it is?
What do you need?
Oh, right. I was worried you didn't recognize me and were going to throw me out.
Let me call someone who could help you.
How can I help you?
Just kidding, I'm crashing the party.
No one can find them. I think this may be an extended episode of Candid Camera.
Let me help you look for them.
