I can't find the bathroom. Do you know where it is?
I can possibly answer it for you.
Oh, right. I was worried you didn't recognize me and were going to throw me out.
How can I help you?
It's a beautiful house. I wonder who does the landscaping.
I saw them in the kitchen.
No one can find them. I think this may be an extended episode of Candid Camera.
