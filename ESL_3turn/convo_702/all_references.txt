Sure thing.
I can't find the bathroom. Do you know where it is?
I can possibly answer it for you.
What do you need?
Oh, right. I was worried you didn't recognize me and were going to throw me out.
Where should I put the dish I brought?
Let me call someone who could help you.
How can I help you?
Just kidding, I'm crashing the party.
It's a beautiful house. I wonder who does the landscaping.
I saw them in the kitchen.
No one can find them. I think this may be an extended episode of Candid Camera.
I just saw them!
Before you ask, there is no toilet paper.
Let me help you look for them.
