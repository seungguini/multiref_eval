Lots of rain and storms heading our way.
It should be sunny.
Rainy on Saturday unfortunately.
There's going to be more rain.
It is supposed to be nice and warm on Saturday, but Sunday it will cool down.
Rainy and miserable.
It's supposed to be really hot and humid both days.
It will be nice, we should do something.
