Lots of rain and storms heading our way.
It should be sunny.
It is supposed to be nice and warm on Saturday, but Sunday it will cool down.
Rainy and miserable.
It's supposed to be really hot and humid both days.
Cold with a chance of snow.
Cloudy and overcast.
It will be nice, we should do something.
