I don't have to be under my parents' roof.
I don't really like anything about it.
Actually, nothing.
Its fun to be so close to other students.
I got to leave home.
I have a lot of fun with my roommates.
Everything about it.
I've made a lot of friends from the dorm.
I finally get freedom to be me.
My roommates are awesome!
It's near all my classes.
