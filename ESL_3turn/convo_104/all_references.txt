You should move in with me.
Where are you planning to live then?
That is a good plan.
Where will you move to?
We could share the rent on an apartment.
I'm sorry to hear that. Was it a big increase?
Move to my area, it is cheaper.
Have you found a new place yet?
Did he give you a reason for raising the rent?
I guess you could always move back in with your parents.
I have a spare bedroom if you need a place to stay for a while.
