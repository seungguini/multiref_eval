You should move in with me.
Where are you planning to live then?
That is a good plan.
We could share the rent on an apartment.
Move to my area, it is cheaper.
Have you found a new place yet?
Did he give you a reason for raising the rent?
I have a spare bedroom if you need a place to stay for a while.
