You should move in with me.
Where are you planning to live then?
Where will you move to?
We could share the rent on an apartment.
I'm sorry to hear that. Was it a big increase?
Move to my area, it is cheaper.
I guess you could always move back in with your parents.
I have a spare bedroom if you need a place to stay for a while.
