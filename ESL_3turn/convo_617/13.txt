Will you be able to get the courses you need to graduate?
Surely, it's hard.
It will be fine.
You had no problem getting used to this one.
It's not that hard, you should try it.
Why do you think so?
Don't you think they're all pretty much alike anyway?
Why should it be so hard to adjust to the new school?
