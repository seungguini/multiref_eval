Where was the last place you remember having it?
You can always go to a window and report it lost and get a new one.
You can get another one.
You should try to get a refund!
Yikes, see if you can retrace your steps.
No one can use it, you can just get a replacement at ticketing.
I think it's right there.
Oh no, we're almost at the front of the line!
That's terrible.
We better look for it!
You need one to board.
That's a lot of money!
It's going down the street.
Maybe you left it at the desk?
