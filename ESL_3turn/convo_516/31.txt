I agree, they do.
They do, but that would make too much sense.
I wish they would put one in.
Right, I do not think we will make it through this light this time because there are so many cars ahead.
Yes, why don't they have one?
Maybe one of us should get out and direct traffic.
That would make sense.
That would definitely wipe out the congestion.
