I agree, they do.
No, I think they're going right.
I wish they would put one in.
Right, I do not think we will make it through this light this time because there are so many cars ahead.
I wonder if we could petition the city for one.
Yeah, I think so, too.
Yes, why don't they have one?
That would definitely wipe out the congestion.
