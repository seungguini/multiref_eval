Did you get drunk?
My ride to the airport got a flat tire on the way.
Oh okay, I'm sure they can reschedule something.
Nice! Did you get drunk and missed your name over the intercom?
How? Were you talking to other patrons?
I left the hotel too late to make it to the airport in time.
Thats not good.
Yeah those bars are so loud, i'm not surprised that you didn't hear your flight announcement.
I met someone during vacation and lost track of time.
