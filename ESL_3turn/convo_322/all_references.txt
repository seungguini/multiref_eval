I'm parked legally.
What sign?
But I did read the sign.
I apologize officer. I'm not from around here.
Just put the ticket on the windshield.  I'll pay it later.
You're a jerk!
I thought that didn't apply to today.
Terribly sorry, I must have missed it.
I can't read this sign.
Are you serious right now?
Can you please give me a break?
That sign is impossible to understand.
