But I did read the sign.
I apologize officer. I'm not from around here.
Just put the ticket on the windshield.  I'll pay it later.
I thought that didn't apply to today.
Terribly sorry, I must have missed it.
I can't read this sign.
Can you please give me a break?
That sign is impossible to understand.
