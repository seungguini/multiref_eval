No I didn't.
I didn't tell them anything because I thought you told them the day before we left.
I'll just leave them a note about the plants.
Well, I guess our plants are now dead.
No, I told you to ask Mr. Smith before we left.
We have a lot of dead plants.
Oh this is a slaughtering ground.
This is horrible.
