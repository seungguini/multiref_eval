No I forgot about that.
I didn't tell them anything because I thought you told them the day before we left.
Crap, how bad are they?
I'll just leave them a note about the plants.
Well, I guess our plants are now dead.
No, I told you to ask Mr. Smith before we left.
We have a lot of dead plants.
This is horrible.
