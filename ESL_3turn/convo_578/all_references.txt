I thought you said it sucks.
Not all poems are bad, but it's just not my thing.
And you are the only one, and you are lukewarm.
Do you like it?
That's generous of you.
I just find poetry to be rather boring.
Not enough to justify it.
What kind do you like?
I don't like it at all.
I disagree.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
I'm sure there are some good poems are there.
I just find it boring.
