I certainly hope so.
Judy sure will!
I hope so.  She was really sad about leaving her old school.
Judy has a hard time making friends.
The new school is amazing.  It has an incredible reputation.
I met some of the kids already.  They are so smart.
She worked really hard to get in here.
The kids don't seem too friend.
