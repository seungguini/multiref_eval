Judy sure will!
I just hope she fits in. This is a really different school.
I think she will.
Judy has a hard time making friends.
The new school is amazing.  It has an incredible reputation.
Yes, it's great that all the students are really into math and science.
I met some of the kids already.  They are so smart.
She worked really hard to get in here.
