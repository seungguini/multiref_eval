Judy sure will!
I hope so.  She was really sad about leaving her old school.
I just hope she fits in. This is a really different school.
She's already made up her mind that she doesn't like it.
The new school is amazing.  It has an incredible reputation.
Yes, it's great that all the students are really into math and science.
She worked really hard to get in here.
