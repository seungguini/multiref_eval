I certainly hope so.
I just hope she fits in. This is a really different school.
As long as she gives it a chance.
Judy has a hard time making friends.
The new school is amazing.  It has an incredible reputation.
I met some of the kids already.  They are so smart.
She worked really hard to get in here.
The kids don't seem too friend.
