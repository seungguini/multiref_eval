I certainly hope so.
Judy sure will!
I hope so.  She was really sad about leaving her old school.
I just hope she fits in. This is a really different school.
As long as she gives it a chance.
I think she will.
Judy has a hard time making friends.
Yes, it's cool that everyone is in theater and arts.
She's already made up her mind that she doesn't like it.
The new school is amazing.  It has an incredible reputation.
Yes, it's great that all the students are really into math and science.
I met some of the kids already.  They are so smart.
She worked really hard to get in here.
The kids don't seem too friend.
