I certainly hope so.
Judy sure will!
I hope so.  She was really sad about leaving her old school.
As long as she gives it a chance.
I think she will.
The new school is amazing.  It has an incredible reputation.
Yes, it's great that all the students are really into math and science.
She worked really hard to get in here.
