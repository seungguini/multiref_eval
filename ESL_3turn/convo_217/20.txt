Judy sure will!
I just hope she fits in. This is a really different school.
As long as she gives it a chance.
I think she will.
She's already made up her mind that she doesn't like it.
Yes, it's great that all the students are really into math and science.
I met some of the kids already.  They are so smart.
The kids don't seem too friend.
