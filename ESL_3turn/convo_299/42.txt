Thank you for meeting with me.
Thank you for your time, Mr. Stevens.
Thank you.
Sounds good.
I brought a copy of my resume and letters of reference, in case you're interested.
I'm interested in getting life insurance.
I'm glad to meet you Mr. Jones.
I have all the information you asked me to bring.
