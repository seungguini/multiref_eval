Thank you for your time, Mr. Stevens.
Thank you.
Yes.  What kind of questions do you have for me?
Sounds good.
I brought a copy of my resume and letters of reference, in case you're interested.
It's great to meet you Mr. Jones.
Great!  I have a lot of options I think you'll be interested in.
I'm glad to meet you Mr. Jones.
