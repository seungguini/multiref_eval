Thank you.
Yes.  What kind of questions do you have for me?
Sounds good.
I brought a copy of my resume and letters of reference, in case you're interested.
Thanks. It's nice to meet you Mr. Jones.
I'm interested in getting life insurance.
I'm glad to meet you Mr. Jones.
I have all the information you asked me to bring.
