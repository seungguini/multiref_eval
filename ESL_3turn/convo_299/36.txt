Thank you for meeting with me.
Of course.
Yes.  What kind of questions do you have for me?
Sounds good.
I brought a copy of my resume and letters of reference, in case you're interested.
I'm interested in getting life insurance.
It's great to meet you Mr. Jones.
Great!  I have a lot of options I think you'll be interested in.
