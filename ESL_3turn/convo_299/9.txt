Thank you for meeting with me.
Thank you for your time, Mr. Stevens.
Of course.
Thank you.
I brought a copy of my resume and letters of reference, in case you're interested.
Great!  I have a lot of options I think you'll be interested in.
I'm glad to meet you Mr. Jones.
I have all the information you asked me to bring.
