Thank you for your time, Mr. Stevens.
Yes.  What kind of questions do you have for me?
I brought a copy of my resume and letters of reference, in case you're interested.
Thanks. It's nice to meet you Mr. Jones.
I'm interested in getting life insurance.
It's great to meet you Mr. Jones.
Great!  I have a lot of options I think you'll be interested in.
I have all the information you asked me to bring.
