They're roller-blades, that's why.
Well that's because you're from the 70's and i'm not.
Well I am wearing roller blades, you are not.
Have you ever tried to rollerblade?
Oh yeah, they are different.
They both still have wheels and roll though.
These are the new ones they just started selling.
I have trouble balancing on the ones you have.
