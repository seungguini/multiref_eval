I just will have a small piece.  I promise it won't spoil my dinner.
But I'm so hungry.
But, Mom, one piece won't hurt.
Dad said I could!
Please can I have a piece?
I'll share some with you.
I don't care! I don't like meatloaf!
It's only one little piece.
I don't like what you're making for dinner.
No I'm so hungry it'll be OK.
Don't worry about it.
