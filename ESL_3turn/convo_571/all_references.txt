Well, I have one thousand.
Wow, that is a lot of friends. How did you meet so many of them?
Are they true friends?
That's a lot!
Do you know all of their names.
Did you meet them all at school?
Wow, that's a lot.
How did you meet so many?
Oh, you mean Facebook friends.
Do you hang out with all of them or just a few?
Do you ever feel lonely?
I don't believe you.
How many are close friends?
You must be very social.
