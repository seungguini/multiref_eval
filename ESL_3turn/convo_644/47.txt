You may be right, it is close to the end of the month.
Because they can.
Well, I know who I call when I'm in serious trouble, 911.
They may need to reach a quota.
Traffic tickets are what most people think of first.
You're just angry because of that speeding ticket you got last week.
At least they are patrolling the city.
I'd rather get a ticket than get robbed!
