If they weren't there at all, you'd like it less.
Because they can.
I think they like to do both.
They may need to reach a quota.
The tickets they write are part of keeping people safe.
You're just angry because of that speeding ticket you got last week.
At least they are patrolling the city.
I'd rather get a ticket than get robbed!
