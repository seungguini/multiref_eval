You must have gotten a lot of tickets to think that way.
Well, I know who I call when I'm in serious trouble, 911.
I think they like to do both.
They may need to reach a quota.
The tickets they write are part of keeping people safe.
I think these people are parked on a no parking zone.
At least they are patrolling the city.
I'd rather get a ticket than get robbed!
