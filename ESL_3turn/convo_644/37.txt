You must have gotten a lot of tickets to think that way.
You may be right, it is close to the end of the month.
Well, I know who I call when I'm in serious trouble, 911.
The tickets they write are part of keeping people safe.
I think these people are parked on a no parking zone.
You're just angry because of that speeding ticket you got last week.
At least they are patrolling the city.
I'd rather get a ticket than get robbed!
