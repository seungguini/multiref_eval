You must have gotten a lot of tickets to think that way.
If they weren't there at all, you'd like it less.
I think they like to do both.
They may need to reach a quota.
I can't stand the officers.  They are so tough.
The tickets they write are part of keeping people safe.
You're just angry because of that speeding ticket you got last week.
I'd rather get a ticket than get robbed!
