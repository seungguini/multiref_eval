If they weren't there at all, you'd like it less.
You may be right, it is close to the end of the month.
Because they can.
Well, I know who I call when I'm in serious trouble, 911.
I can't stand the officers.  They are so tough.
The tickets they write are part of keeping people safe.
At least they are patrolling the city.
I'd rather get a ticket than get robbed!
