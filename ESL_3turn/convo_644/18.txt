You must have gotten a lot of tickets to think that way.
If they weren't there at all, you'd like it less.
You may be right, it is close to the end of the month.
Because they can.
They may need to reach a quota.
I can't stand the officers.  They are so tough.
I think these people are parked on a no parking zone.
You're just angry because of that speeding ticket you got last week.
