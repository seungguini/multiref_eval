If they weren't there at all, you'd like it less.
Because they can.
I think they like to do both.
They may need to reach a quota.
I can't stand the officers.  They are so tough.
Traffic tickets are what most people think of first.
You're just angry because of that speeding ticket you got last week.
At least they are patrolling the city.
