You may be right, it is close to the end of the month.
Because they can.
Well, I know who I call when I'm in serious trouble, 911.
I think they like to do both.
I can't stand the officers.  They are so tough.
The tickets they write are part of keeping people safe.
You're just angry because of that speeding ticket you got last week.
At least they are patrolling the city.
