You must have gotten a lot of tickets to think that way.
If they weren't there at all, you'd like it less.
Because they can.
I think they like to do both.
The tickets they write are part of keeping people safe.
I think these people are parked on a no parking zone.
You're just angry because of that speeding ticket you got last week.
At least they are patrolling the city.
