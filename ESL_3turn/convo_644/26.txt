You must have gotten a lot of tickets to think that way.
I think they like to do both.
They may need to reach a quota.
I can't stand the officers.  They are so tough.
Traffic tickets are what most people think of first.
I think these people are parked on a no parking zone.
You're just angry because of that speeding ticket you got last week.
I'd rather get a ticket than get robbed!
