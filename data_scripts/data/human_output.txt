It is an up and coming area with a lot of projects underway.
What if we rent a car?
Thats not good.
There's one on her desk

There's plenty of Universities that are safe and away from crime.
I don't understand why you have a problem with the waiter's hands?

I have to depend on public transportation and the buses are always running behind schedule.
Do you know if they stole any of your information?
Can I hear what your appetizers are?
Then why isn't she wearing it?
Alright, please remain calm. I'll get the doctor.
That's great!
What happened?
I could never bake and decorate a cake on my own!
Why do you need to make a withdraw?
I'm so glad that we decided to share it.
I would love to go with you.
I do it all the time and am glad to help you!
I think she's married.
The water at the bottom can pull you under, and you could drown.

You're right. Let me fix it.
Just making sure.
Is she bleeding?
We have a half an hour.
She is my cousin.
No, what happened.
The teacher has it out for me.
Do you think they're going to put you with little kids?
No, I am here for an interview.
You need to get out there and play to get better.
Harvard, have you heard of it?
Yeah, ridiculous right?
That's good, are you coming?
What kind of forms do I have to fill out?
Just walk a few blocks and you'll be there.
Yes. Give me a few minutes to get ready.
Will that make you late?
I wonder if the company pays their employees well.
I washed all of the socks that were in the hamper.
Ok, let me check for you.
I don't care if they're busy. This wait is getting to be ridiculous.
I don't even know who most of those TV stars are.

They disagreed on what religion with which to raise me.
It's usually like this when it rains.
Aren't you bringing your girlfriend?
I'm picky about the pictures I post online.
That;s an easy fix.
I thought it was supposed to be on the 15th.
She always assumes and doesn't ask me first.
You should do it before someone else does?
I've always wanted to go there.
I'm very skeptical of that.
I heard that babies get gas a lot.
Okay then let's get you started.

I still don't understand.
Many fees.
They didn't specify, but they said I had "stomach issues."
No. Just put your trash in either one.
You can check your bags in early at the baggage claim office.
That sounds like a money maker if you have some old guns laying around.
She could if she doesn't have anywhere to put them.
Were you injured?
Well, why don't you go online to get some ideas?
Maybe.
The flowers are for my mom.

I'm so relieved
I come from two towns over
Yes, but it was a long time ago and I don't remember my score.
I know, it drives me nuts that you have to pay so much to check your bags now.

If it's minor, do you mind if we talk about it tomorrow?
I'm starving
That's a bummer.
Have you heard of absentee voting?
How tiny?
What were you sick with?
I would prefer warm if we are walking.

Are you sure you weren't on drugs?
Watching tv is my job.
Make sure you visit the aquarium.

We smoke too many cigarettes for that
I think that's a fair cut off.
I hate baseball.
I need to do homework.
Anyplace cheap and casual.
I don't know if that's a good idea.
Everyone is really friendly and help each other out.
Wait a minute, are those bugs?
Imagine your steering wheel as a clock

Why not just stay a little longer?
I usually just pay with cash or show my student ID.

How come?
How are you today?
I have 12pm to 5pm so my entire day is full.
That's for sure.
That man was lucky.
My favorite is watching people who are watching other people.

You can if you want to.
I didn't see a stop sign.
There should be cheese or lunch meat in there.
Are you still feeling nauseous?
We can go to different sites.
You can order something for delivery.
I don't watch television.

Cool!  Can I come with you?
How fast is he going?
Was he cooking something before he fell asleep?

I mean, it's fine, but I feel like it's a little cheap looking, you know?
Where should I put the dish I brought?
Ask away!
Already checked them.
Okay, let's get that first.
When do they start?
I don't actually work here. You should probably go ask at the counter.
It really was!
It's near the highway.
What time is your interview?
I usually just eat food.
Oh, do you like the changes?

Sometimes it is.
Just 2 minutes from my work.
I'm running a little late because my son forgot his lunchbox at home.
I wanted to take a break and eat a snack.
Only once in a while.
Who was involved in that?
Any idea what it was about?
Sounds reasonable.
Well why haven't you yet?
I guess I'm old, haha.
That's an awful thing to do, I think you should be honest with her and not put gum in her hair.
Why do you say that?
Just let him go.
And what else?
Alright, number 3 looks just like him.
I don't know how to get there.
Is she good looking?
Would you feel better at home?
Friday would be nice and return in a week please.

From what I've heard yes they are.
Well, she's just not pretty.
I'll be there after class around 3:00.
Even if I didn't know you I would still vote for you!
I know I always get shut out.
Aw, okay. I hope you feel better.
Where is the customer service counter?
Who is your favorite artist?
It's kind of ridiculous that it's required.
I hit something while backing out.
Get a second job.
I will still try if you like.
It's too cold in the winter.
Have you ever heard of the sport "curling"?  That's what they are doing.
I'm quite sure they will.
What did you see?
I need to come up with the money for it.
I can call a taxi for you.
I'll need the copy of the check.
Have you looked on Craigslist?
There should be one at 3:10 pm.
If you knew me well you wouldn't ask such a silly question.
You can't park on the street on weekdays between 6 am and 3 pm.
I'll help you look.
Speak for yourself.
You believe everything you hear?
I don't actually live here.
You're wrong.
I don't have any money to spend there
And who is to blame for that?
is he trying to tell you something
they are hot
I have meetings here.
Really? That's shocking.
Yes he knew
It was perfect weather but then the plane hit turbulence
I need to get to the store fast!
Where is he? We need to make sure he's okay!
How do I change them?
Do you need help with anything?
Why are you worried about him?
I'll bring the tools so we can get started.
I recommend you see a chiropractor instead!
You asked that last semester.
Everyone is just as nervous to give theirs when it is their turn
That's kind of obvious.
OK feel free.
Yes I am. They got damaged by the last storm we had.
I'm not sure.
How much are you looking to spend?
You didn't tell me that.
Yes, there is.
Oh no! You need to hire someone to fix it up.
I don't know how to help you.
Wait, what is the date today?
I think that's a major cause.
How did that happen?
Yes, that would be great.
Why did the chicken cross the road?
Oh, wow.  Do you have any prospects for a new job yet?
I'll be careful.
Hard work creates perseverance.
Okay, let me take a look at the calendar.
Ask some money from friends or family.
The color copies cost a little more.
That's the way my husband likes them.
Are you spying on me?
Well then see if you can get a discount.
Yes, I would get a checking and a savings account.
Maybe you should check out a job listing site for ideas of what to do.
I figured that's how you got to work every day.
I will ask the lady at the desk.
Maybe they don't carry it at this store?
Yes, but it is very beautiful out here.
Maybe he wanted to get into the Guinness Book of World Records.
Do you mean something like Facebook.
So?  Do I care?
You must really be desperate then.
It will take a while.
None of your business.
More hours means more money.
What color is it then?
You'll be happier being a nurse.
I'm going to order a diet coke instead.
Does he know who he's talking to?
Its okay.
I don't like science.
I'm leaning towards voting in favor of them, but I'm still undecided.
Your email address.
Of course! Let me grab that for you.
The bruschetta.
Well, practice makes perfect.
Do you shop online?
I can, what time would you like me to pick you up?
I can meet you there Wednesday at 1pm, does that work?
He's not the obvious choice.
That's fine this time.  Get on.
OH JAMES MOM,NICE TO MEET YOU
I bought some toys for the grandkids.
We'll be helping the environment.
DID YOU NEED TO SEE
So a savings account then?
It's fine.
A lot of people have the flu.
I've been throwing up for days.
Maybe you're right.
You need to relax.
Congratulations on getting hired.
Are you able to provide directions?
Sure, bring it in tomorrow!
That's exciting. Where are you guys gonna go?
It means you paid by check and didn't have enough money in your account.
Do you ever watch the news?
You could have killed someone!
I make more than you working at home how doesn't that count?
But I barely know you at all.
The color would be nice though.
What are the rules for applying?
No problem I will move it.
No problem!
Who are you going to use it on?
They are lying.
I love watching football and rooting for my favorite team.
Most people would not say anything, thank you for catching that.
Do you make your own?
That sounds terrible.
I cut the fee in half then.
Your month pass works just as well.
Yes but it's not.
The times they are a changing.
How about some escargot tonight?
Do they know who did it?
So you'd like to subscribe to our newspaper?
I didn't touch the frosting at all.
I'll get my shotgun.
Wow, that really is a bad picture of you.

And the carpet was filthy!
I'm going to help you.
The veil was so long and beautiful.
The monthly fee is five dollars.
I want to be an English professor.
The crime is really low.
Let me call the head of HR who will join us in this meeting.
Are you in a hurry to get somewhere?
I don't really even understand what the difference is.
To the lake.
Which one are you looking for?
Sorry.
Could you please fill out this paperwork for me?
He said that it does.
I left a case of soda in it overnight in the dead of winter.
The boss yelled at me in front of everyone.
I wonder who these people are.
I think you'll like it, it's a classic.
I stopped eating sugar.
I filled out a form at a registration booth.
I wonder how many creatures live there that we've never discovered.
Is anybody hurt?
The calico is my favorite.
How long did you look for?
Great, let's go now.
What time do you want to get there?
Why can't you feed him?
Did you tell your boss?
Jesus Christ! You can't be doing stuff like that.
How did that turn out?
If you need just one or two I can supply you with them for free.
No that show sucks.
If anybodies confused here it's you. You date more women than anybody I've ever met.
Maybe the point of living is to help others.
How am I being stereotypical?
A friend from work.
it was really good. just tired.
I'm sorry but that's not something that I would be able to help you with.
He proves that age is just a number.
What's so scary about that?

You know that your diet can cause your face to break out.
I also need a pump and needle to keep my ball inflated.
Did their dog get out?
It's wonderful.  Everything seems so peaceful and quiet whenever it snows.
Do you want to go shop for one now?
What if it's something urgent?
I'm not sure of the number, but it's the one from maywood to Corona.
I'm not loaning you any money to buy one.
I don't have a mirror with me.
Depends on my mood.
Are you thiking of a meal or a snack?
Call the guy.
Wow, that's commitment!
It only takes one second and they can take off in their own direction.
I really should, but I've been procrastinating.
We've never spoken, to be honest.
I don't know but I think it's possible.
Alright, what time?
Great, I hope it all goes well.
The first time I was, but now I am not.
I think I'll skip out on lunch.
One can dream.
Well you have to go where the work is.
It's actually used in a sport called lacrosse.
Where are you headed?
That's a good way to save on some things.
What do I need to do to file?
I suppose that's a good point.
Yes. I am having a hard time finding what I'm looking for.
I think you should get a tutor.
Oh that is disgusting, we will send someone right up
